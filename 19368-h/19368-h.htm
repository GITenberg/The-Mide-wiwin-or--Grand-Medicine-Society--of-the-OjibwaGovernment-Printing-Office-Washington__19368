<p class = "mynote">
This e-text contains a few letters with unusual diacritics:<br>
<span class = "pad1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ā ē ī ō ū (vowel with macron or
“long” mark)<br>
<span class = "pad1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ (vowel with breve or
“short” mark)<br>
If any of these characters do not display properly&mdash;in particular,
if the diacritic does not appear directly above the
letter&mdash;or if the quotation marks in this paragraph appear as
garbage, you may have an incompatible browser or unavailable fonts.
First, make sure that the browser’s “character set” or “file encoding”
is set to Unicode (UTF-8). You may also need to change your browser’s
default font. Note that the accent marks, as in “Midē´wiwin,” are
<i>not</i> meant to display on top of any letter.<br>
<br>
Some typographical errors have been corrected. They have been
marked in the text with <ins class = "correction" title =
"like this">mouse-hover popups</ins>. The variation between “Ojibwa” and
“Ojibway” is as in the original.<br>

OF THE OJIBWAY.</h4>

<p>The Ojibwa is one of the largest tribes of the United States, and it
is scattered over a considerable area, from the Province of Ontario, on
the east, to the Red River of the North, on the west, and from Manitoba
southward through the States of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. This
tribe is, strictly speaking, a timber people, and in its westward
migration or dispersion has never passed beyond the limit of the timber
growth which so remarkably divides the State of Minnesota into two parts
possessing distinct physical features. The western portion of this State
is a gently undulating prairie which sweeps away to the Rocky Mountains,
while the eastern portion is heavily timbered. The dividing line, at or
near the meridian of 95° 50' west longitude, extends due north and
south, and at a point about 75 miles south of the northern boundary the
timber line trends toward the northwest, crossing the State line, 49°
north latitude, at about 97° 10' west longitude.</p>

<p>Minnesota contains many thousand lakes of various sizes, some of
which are connected by fine water courses, while others are entirely
isolated. The wooded country is undulating, the elevated portions being
covered chiefly with pine, fir, spruce, and other coniferous trees, and
the lowest depressions being occupied by lakes, ponds, or marshes,
around which occur the tamarack, willow, and other trees which thrive in
moist ground, while the regions between these extremes are covered with
oak, poplar, ash, birch, maple, and many other varieties of trees and
shrubs.</p>

<p>Wild fowl, game, and fish are still abundant, and until recently have
furnished to the Indians the chief source of subsistence.</p>

<p>Tribal organization according to the totemic system is practically
broken up, as the Indians are generally located upon or near the several
reservations set apart for them by the General Government, where they
have been under more or less restraint by the United States Indian
agents and the missionaries. Representatives of various totems or gentes
may therefore be found upon a single reservation,
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
<a name = "page150" id = "page150"> </a>
<!--png 196-->
where they continue to adhere to traditional customs and beliefs, thus
presenting an interesting field for ethnologic research.</p>

<p>The present distribution of the Ojibwa in Minnesota and Wisconsin is
indicated upon the accompanying map, <a href = "#plateII">Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">II</span></a>. In the southern portion many of
these people have adopted civilized pursuits, but throughout the
northern and northwestern part many bands continue to adhere to their
primitive methods and are commonly designated “wild Indians.” The
habitations of many of the latter are rude and primitive. The bands on
the northeast shore of Red Lake, as well as a few others farther east,
have occupied these isolated sites for an uninterrupted period of about
three centuries, as is affirmed by the chief men of the several villages
and corroborated by other traditional evidence.</p>

<p>Father Claude Alloüez, upon his arrival in 1666 at Shagawaumikong, or
La Pointe, found the Ojibwa preparing to attack the Sioux. The
settlement at this point was an extensive one, and in traditions
pertaining to the “Grand Medicine Society” frequent allusion is made to
the fact that at this place the rites were practiced in their greatest
purity.</p>

<p>Mr. Warren, in his History of the Ojibwa Indians,<a class = "tag"
href = "#note1" name = "tag1" id = "tag1">1</a> bases his belief upon
traditional evidence that the Ojibwa first had knowledge of the whites
in 1612. Early in the seventeenth century the French missionaries met
with various tribes of the Algonkian linguistic stock, as well as with
bands or subtribes of the Ojibwa Indians. One of the latter, inhabiting
the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie, is frequently mentioned in the Jesuit
Relations as the Saulteurs. This term was applied to all those people
who lived at the Falls, but from other statements it is clear that the
Ojibwa formed the most important body in that vicinity. La Hontan speaks
of the “Outchepoues, alias Sauteurs,” as good warriors. The name
Saulteur survives at this day and is applied to a division of the
tribe.</p>

<p>According to statements made by numerous Ojibwa chiefs of importance
the tribe began its westward dispersion from La Pointe and Fond du Lac
at least two hundred and fifty years ago, some of the bands penetrating
the swampy country of northern Minnesota, while others went westward and
southwestward. According to a statement<a class = "tag" href = "#note2"
name = "tag2" id = "tag2">2</a> of the location of the tribes of Lake
Superior, made at Mackinaw in 1736, the Sioux then occupied the southern
and northern extremities of that lake. It is possible, however, that the
northern bands of the Ojibwa may have penetrated the region adjacent to
the Pigeon River and passed west to near their present location, thus
avoiding their enemies who occupied the lake shore south of them.</p>

<!--png 199-->
From recent investigations among a number of tribes of the Algonkian
linguistic division it is found that the traditions and practices
pertaining to the Midē´wiwin, Society of the Midē´ or Shamans, popularly
designated as the “Grand Medicine Society,” prevailed generally, and the
rites are still practiced at irregular intervals, though in slightly
different forms in various localities.</p>

<p>In the reports of early travelers and missionaries no special mention
is made of the Midē´, the Jes´sakkīd´, or the Wâbĕnō´, but the term
sorcerer or juggler is generally employed to designate that class of
persons who professed the power of prophecy, and who practiced
incantation and administered medicinal preparations. Constant reference
is made to the opposition of these personages to the introduction of
Christianity. In the light of recent investigation the cause of this
antagonism is seen to lie in the fact that the traditions of Indian
genesis and cosmogony and the ritual of initiation into the Society of
the Midē´ constitute what is to them a religion, even more powerful and
impressive than the Christian religion is to the average civilized man.
This opposition still exists among the leading classes of a number of
the Algonkian tribes, and especially among the Ojibwa, many bands of
whom have been more or less isolated and beyond convenient reach of the
Church. The purposes of the society are twofold; first, to preserve the
traditions just mentioned, and second, to give a certain class of
ambitious men and women sufficient influence through their acknowledged
power of exorcism and necromancy to lead a comfortable life at the
expense of the credulous. The persons admitted into the society are
firmly believed to possess the power of communing with various
supernatural beings&mdash;manidos&mdash;and in order that certain
desires may be realized they are sought after and consulted. The purpose
of the present paper is to give an account of this society and of the
ceremony of initiation as studied and observed at White Earth,
Minnesota, in 1889. Before proceeding to this, however, it may be of
interest to consider a few statements made by early travelers respecting
the “sorcerers or jugglers” and the methods of medication.</p>

<p>In referring to the practices of the Algonkian tribes of the
Northwest, La Hontan<a class = "tag" href = "#note3" name = "tag3" id =
"tag3">3</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>When they are sick, they only drink Broth, and eat
sparingly; and if they have the good luck to fall asleep, they think
themselves cur’d: They have told me frequently, that sleeping and
sweating would cure the most stubborn Diseases in the World. When they
are so weak that they cannot get out of Bed, their Relations come and
dance and make merry before ’em, in order to divert ’em. To conclude,
when they are ill, they are always visited by a sort of Quacks,
(<i>Jongleurs</i>); of whom ’t will now be proper to subjoin two or
three Words by the bye.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <i>Jongleur</i> is a sort of <i>Physician</i>, or rather a
<i>Quack</i>, who being once cur’d of some dangerous Distemper, has the
Presumption and Folly to fancy that he is immortal, and possessed of the
Power of curing all Diseases, by speaking to the Good and Evil Spirits.
Now though every Body rallies upon these Fellows when
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
<a name = "page152" id = "page152"> </a>
<!--png 200-->
they are absent, and looks upon ’em as Fools that have lost their Senses
by some violent Distemper, yet they allow ’em to visit the Sick; whether
it be to divert ’em with their Idle Stories, or to have an Opportunity
of seeing them rave, skip about, cry, houl, and make Grimaces and Wry
Faces, as if they were possess’d. When all the Bustle is over, they
demand a Feast of a Stag and some large Trouts for the Company, who are
thus regal’d at once with Diversion and Good Cheer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the Quack comes to visit the Patient, he examines him
very carefully; <i>If the Evil Spirit be here</i>, says he, <i>we shall
quickly dislodge him.</i> This said, he withdraws by himself to a little
Tent made on purpose, where he dances, and sings houling like an Owl;
(which gives the Jesuits Occasion to say, <i>That the Devil converses
with ’em</i>.) After he has made an end of this Quack Jargon, he comes
and rubs the Patient in some part of his Body, and pulling some little
Bones out of his Mouth, acquaints the Patient, <i>That these very Bones
came out of his Body; that he ought to pluck up a good heart, in regard
that his Distemper is but a Trifle; and in fine, that in order to
accelerate the Cure, ’t will be convenient to send his own and his
Relations Slaves to shoot Elks, Deer, &amp;c., to the end they may all
eat of that sort of Meat, upon which his Cure does absolutely
depend.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Commonly these Quacks bring ’em some Juices of Plants, which
are a sort of Purges, and are called <i>Maskikik</i>.</blockquote>

<p>Hennepin, in “A Continuation of the New Discovery,” etc.,<a class =
"tag" href = "#note4" name = "tag4" id = "tag4">4</a> speaks of the
religion and sorcerers of the tribes of the St. Lawrence and those
living about the Great Lakes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>We have been all too sadly convinced, that almost all the
Salvages in general have no notion of a God, and that they are not able
to comprehend the most ordinary Arguments on that Subject; others will
have a Spirit that commands, say they, in the Air. Some among ’em look
upon the Skie as a kind of Divinity; others as an <i>Otkon</i> or
<i>Manitou</i>, either Good or Evil.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These People admit of some sort of Genius in all things;
they all believe there is a Master of Life, as they call him, but hereof
they make various applications; some of them have a lean Raven, which
they carry always along with them, and which they say is the Master of
their Life; others have an Owl, and some again a Bone, a Sea-Shell, or
some such thing;</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is no Nation among ’em which has not a sort of Juglers
or Conjuerers, which some look upon to be Wizards, but in my Opinion
there is no Great reason to believe ’em such, or to think that their
Practice favours any thing of a Communication with the
Devil.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These Impostors cause themselves to be reverenced as
Prophets which fore-tell Futurity. They will needs be look’d upon to
have an unlimited Power. They boast of being able to make it Wet or Dry;
to cause a Calm or a Storm; to render Land Fruitful or Barren; and, in a
Word to make Hunters Fortunate or Unfortunate. They also pretend to
Physick, and to apply Medicines, but which are such, for the most part
as have little Virtue at all in ’em, especially to Cure that Distemper
which they pretend&nbsp;to.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is impossible to imagine, the horrible Howlings and
strange Contortions that those Jugglers make of their Bodies, when they
are disposing themselves to Conjure, or raise their
Enchantments.</blockquote>

<p>Marquette, who visited the Miami, Mascontin and Kickapoo Indians in
1673, after referring to the Indian herbalist, mentions also the
ceremony of the “calumet dance,” as follows:</p>

<blockquote>They have Physicians amongst them, towards whom they are
very liberal when they are sick, thinking that the Operation of the
Remedies they take, is proportional to the Presents they make unto those
who have prescrib’d them.</blockquote>

<p><span class = "pagenum">153</span>
<a name = "page153" id = "page153"> </a>
<!--png 201-->
In connection with this, reference is made by Marquette to a certain
class of individuals among the Illinois and Dakota, who were compelled
to wear women’s clothes, and who were debarred many privileges, but were
permitted to “assist at all the Superstitions of their <i>Juglers</i>,
and their solemn Dances in honor of the <i>Calumet</i>, in which they
may sing, but it is not lawful for them to dance. They are call’d to
their Councils, and nothing is determin’d without their Advice; for,
because of their extraordinary way of Living, they are look’d upon as
<i>Manitous</i>, or at least for great and incomparable Genius’s.”</p>

<p>That the calumet was brought into requisition upon all occasions of
interest is learned from the following statement, in which the same
writer declares that it is “the most mysterious thing in the World. The
Sceptres of our Kings are not so much respected; for the Savages have
such a Deference for this Pipe, that one may call it <i>The God of Peace
and War, and the Arbiter of Life and Death</i>. Their <i>Calumet of
Peace</i> is different from the <i>Calumet of War</i>; They make use of
the former to seal their Alliances and Treaties, to travel with safety,
and receive Strangers; and the other is to proclaim War.”</p>

<p>This reverence for the calumet is shown by the manner in which it is
used at dances, in the ceremony of smoking, etc., indicating a religious
devoutness approaching that recently observed among various Algonkian
tribes in connection with the ceremonies of the Midē´wiwin. When the
calumet dance was held, the Illinois appear to have resorted to the
houses in the winter and to the groves in the summer. The above-named
authority continues in this connection:</p>

<blockquote>They chuse for that purpose a set Place among Trees, to
shelter themselves against the Heat of the Sun, and lay in the middle a
large Matt, as a Carpet, to lay upon the God of the Chief of the
Company, who gave the Ball; for every one has his peculiar God, whom
they call <i>Manitoa</i>. It is sometime a Stone, a Bird, a Serpent, or
anything else that they dream of in their Sleep; for they think this
<i>Manitoa</i> will prosper their Wants, as Fishing, Hunting, and other
Enterprizes. To the Right of their <i>Manitoa</i> they place the
<i>Calumet</i>, their Great Deity, making round about it a Kind of
Trophy with their Arms, viz. their Clubs, Axes, Bows, Quivers, and
Arrows.<span class = "pad1"> ***</span>Every Body sits down afterwards,
round about, as they come, having first of all saluted the
<i>Manitoa</i>, which they do in blowing the Smoak of their Tobacco upon
it, which is as much as offering to it Frankincense.<span class =
"pad1"> ***</span>This <i>Preludium</i> being over, he who is to begin
the Dance appears in the middle of the Assembly, and having taken the
<i>Calumet</i>, presents it to the Sun, as if he wou’d invite him to
smoke. Then he moves it into an infinite Number of Postures sometimes
laying it near the Ground, then stretching its Wings, as if he wou’d
make it fly, and then presents it to the Spectators, who smoke with it
one after another, dancing all the while. This is the first Scene of
this famous Ball.</blockquote>

<p>The infinite number of postures assumed in offering the pipe appear
as significant as the “smoke ceremonies” mentioned in connection with
the preparatory instruction of the candidate previous to his initiation
into the Midē´wiwin.</p>

<!--png 202-->
In his remarks on the religion of the Indians and the practices of the
sorcerers, Hennepin says:</p>

<blockquote>As for their Opinion concerning the Earth, they make use of
a Name of a certain <i>Genius</i>, whom they call <i>Micaboche</i>, who
has cover’d the whole Earth with water (as they imagine) and relate
innumerable fabulous Tales, some of which have a kind of Analogy with
the Universal Deluge. These Barbarians believe that there are certain
Spirits in the Air, between Heaven and Earth, who have a power to
foretell future Events, and others who play the part of Physicians,
curing all sorts of Distempers. Upon which account, it happens, that
these <i>Savages</i> are very Superstitious, and consult their Oracles
with a great deal of exactness. One of these Masters-Jugglers who pass
for Sorcerers among them, one day caus’d a Hut to be erected with ten
thick Stakes, which he fix’d very deep in the Ground, and then made a
horrible noise to Consult the Spirits, to know whether abundance of Snow
wou’d fall ere long, that they might have good game in the Hunting of
Elks and Beavers: Afterward he bawl’d out aloud from the bottom of the
Hut, that he saw many Herds of Elks, which were as yet at a very great
distance, but that they drew near within seven or eight Leagues of their
Huts, which caus’d a great deal of joy among those poor deluded
Wretches.</blockquote>

<p>That this statement refers to one or more tribes of the Algonkian
linguistic stock is evident, not only because of the reference to the
sorcerers and their peculiar methods of procedure, but also that the
name of <i>Micaboche</i>, an Algonkian divinity, appears. This Spirit,
who acted as an intercessor between Ki´tshi Man´idō (Great Spirit) and
the Indians, is known among the Ojibwa as Mi´nabō´zho; but to this full
reference will be made further on in connection with the Myth of the
origin of the Midē´wiwin. The tradition of Nokomis (the earth) and the
birth of Manabush (the Mi´nabō´zho of the Menomoni) and his brother, the
Wolf, that pertaining to the re-creation of the world, and fragments of
other myths, are thrown together and in a mangled form presented by
Hennepin in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>Some Salvages which live at the upper end of the River St.
<i>Lawrence</i>, do relate a pretty diverting Story. They hold almost
the same opinion with the former [the Iroquois], that a Woman came down
from Heaven, and remained for some while fluttering in the Air, not
finding Ground whereupon to put her Foot. But that the Fishes moved with
Compassion for her, immediately held a Consultation to deliberate which
of them should receive her. The Tortoise very officiously offered its
Back on the Surface of the Water. The Woman came to rest upon it, and
fixed herself there. Afterwards the Filthiness and Dirt of the Sea
gathering together about the Tortoise, there was formed by little and
little that vast Tract of Land, which we now call
<i>America</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They add that this Woman grew weary of her Solitude, wanting
some body for to keep her Company, that so she might spend her time more
pleasantly. Melancholy and Sadness having seiz’d upon her Spirits, she
fell asleep, and a Spirit descended from above, and finding her in that
Condition approach’d and knew her unperceptibly. From which Approach she
conceived two Children, which came forth out of one of her Ribs. But
these two Brothers could never afterwards agree together. One of them
was a better Huntsman than the other; they quarreled every day; and
their Disputes grew so high at last, that one could not bear with the
other. One especially being of a very wild Temper, hated mortally his
Brother who was of a milder Constitution, who being no longer able to
endure the Pranks of the other,
<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
<a name = "page155" id = "page155"> </a>
<!--png 203-->
he resolved at last to part from him. He retired then into Heaven,
whence, for a Mark of his just Resentment, he causeth at several times
his Thunder to rore over the Head of his unfortunate
Brother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sometime after the Spirit descended again on that Woman, and
she conceived a Daughter, from whom (as the Salvages say) were
propagated these numerous People, which do occupy now one of the
greatest parts of the Universe.</blockquote>

<p>It is evident that the narrator has sufficiently distorted the
traditions to make them conform, as much as practicable, to the biblical
story of the birth of Christ. No reference whatever is made in the
Ojibwa or Menomoni myths to the conception of the Daughter of Nokomis
(the earth) by a celestial visitant, but the reference is to one of the
wind gods. Mi´nabō´zho became angered with the Ki´tshi Man´idō, and the
latter, to appease his discontent, gave to Mi´nabō´zho the rite of the
Midēwiwin. The brother of Mi´nabō´zho was destroyed by the malevolent
underground spirits and now rules the abode of shadows,&mdash;the “Land
of the Midnight Sun.”</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at the “Bay of Puans” (Green Bay, Wisconsin),
Marquette found a village inhabited by three nations, viz: “Miamis,
Maskoutens, and Kikabeux.” He says:</p>

<blockquote>When I arriv’d there, I was very glad to see a great Cross
set up in the middle of the Village, adorn’d with several White Skins,
Red Girdles, Bows and Arrows, which that good People had offer’d to the
Great <i>Manitou</i>, to return him their Thanks for the care he had
taken of them during the Winter, and that he had granted them a
prosperous Hunting. <i>Manitou</i>, is the Name they give in general to
all Spirits whom they think to be above the Nature of Man.</blockquote>

<p>Marquette was without doubt ignorant of the fact that the cross is
the sacred post, and the symbol of the fourth degree of the Midē´wiwin,
as will be fully explained in connection with that grade of the society.
The erroneous conclusion that the cross was erected as an evidence of
the adoption of Christianity, and possibly as a compliment to the
visitor, was a natural one on the part of the priest, but this same
symbol of the Midē´ Society had probably been erected and bedecked with
barbaric emblems and weapons months before anything was known of

<p>The result of personal investigations among the Ojibwa, conducted
during the years 1887, 1888 and 1889, are presented in the accompanying
paper. The information was obtained from a number of the chief Midē´
priests living at Red Lake and White Earth reservations, as well as from
members of the society from other reservations, who visited the last
named locality during the three years. Special mention of the
peculiarity of the music recorded will be made at the proper place; and
it may here be said that in no instance was the use of colors detected,
in any birch-bark or other records or mnemonic songs, simply to heighten
the artistic effect; though the reader would be led by an examination of
the works of Schoolcraft to believe this to be a common practice. Col.

Washington, District of Columbia, in 1888, says, regarding this
subject:</p>

<blockquote>The general character of his voluminous publications has not
been such as to assure modern critics of his accuracy, and the wonderful
minuteness, as well as comprehension, attributed by him to the Ojibwa
hieroglyphs has been generally regarded of late with suspicion. It was
considered in the Bureau of Ethnology an important duty to ascertain how
much of truth existed in these remarkable accounts, and for that purpose
its pictographic specialists, myself and Dr. W.&nbsp;J. Hoffman as
assistant, were last summer directed to proceed to the most favorable
points in the present habitat of the tribe, namely, the northern region
of Minnesota and Wisconsin, to ascertain how much was yet to be
discovered.<span class = "pad1"> ***</span>The general results of the
comparison of Schoolcraft’s statements with what is now found shows
that, in substance, he told the truth, but with much exaggeration and
coloring. The word “coloring” is particularly appropriate, because, in
his copious illustrations, various colors were used freely with apparent
significance, whereas, in fact, the general rule in regard to the
birch-bark rolls was that they were never colored at all; indeed, the
bark was not adapted to coloration. The metaphorical coloring was also
used by him in a manner which, to any thorough student of the Indian
philosophy and religion, seems absurd. Metaphysical expressions are
attached to some of the devices, or, as he calls them, symbols, which,
could never have been entertained by a people in the stage of culture of
the Ojibwa.</blockquote>


<h4 class = "section"><a name = "shamans" id =
"shamans">SHAMANS.</a></h4>

<p>There are extant among the Ojibwa Indians three classes of mystery
men, termed respectively and in order of importance the Midē´, the
Jĕs´sakkīd´, and the Wâbĕnō´, but before proceeding to elaborate in
detail the Society of the Midē´, known as the Midē´wiwin, a brief
description of the last two is necessary.</p>

<p>The term Wâbĕnō´ has been explained by various intelligent Indians as
signifying “Men of the dawn,” “Eastern men,” etc. Their profession is
not thoroughly understood, and their number is so extremely limited that
but little information respecting them can be obtained. Schoolcraft,<a
class = "tag" href = "#note5" name = "tag5" id = "tag5">5</a> in
referring to the several classes of Shamans, says “there is a third form
or rather modification of the medawin,<span class = "pad1">
***</span>the Wâbĕnō´; a term denoting a kind of midnight orgies, which
is regarded as a corruption of the Meda.” This writer furthermore
remarks<a class = "tag" href = "#note6" name = "tag6" id = "tag6">6</a>
that “it is stated by judicious persons among themselves to be of modern
origin. They regard it as a degraded form of the mysteries of the
Meda.”</p>

<p>From personal investigation it has been ascertained that a Wâbĕnō´
does not affiliate with others of his class so as to constitute a
society, but indulges his pretensions individually. A Wâbĕnō´ is
primarily prompted by dreams or visions which may occur during his
youth, for which purpose he leaves his village to fast for an indefinite
number of days. It is positively affirmed that evil man´idōs favor his
desires,
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157" id = "page157"> </a>
<!--png 205-->
and apart from his general routine of furnishing “hunting medicine,”
“love powders,” etc., he pretends also to practice medical magic. When a
hunter has been successful through the supposed assistance of the
Wâbĕnō´, he supplies the latter with part of the game, when, in giving a
feast to his tutelary daimon, the Wâbĕnō´ will invite a number of
friends, but all who desire to come are welcome. This feast is given at
night; singing and dancing are boisterously indulged in, and the
Wâbĕnō´, to sustain his reputation, entertains his visitors with a
further exhibition of his skill. By the use of plants he is alleged to
be enabled to take up and handle with impunity red-hot stones and
burning brands, and without evincing the slightest discomfort it is said
that he will bathe his hands in boiling water, or even boiling maple
sirup. On account of such performances the general impression prevails
among the Indians that the Wâbĕnō´ is a “dealer in fire,” or
“fire-handler.” Such exhibitions always terminate at the approach of
day. The number of these pretenders who are not members of the
Midē´wiwin, is very limited; for instance, there are at present but two
or three at White Earth Reservation and none at Leech Lake.</p>

<p>As a general rule, however, the Wâbĕnō´ will seek entrance into the
Midē´wiwin when he becomes more of a specialist in the practice of
medical magic, incantations, and the exorcism of malevolent man´idōs,
especially such as cause disease.</p>

<p>The Jĕs´sakkīd´ is a seer and prophet; though commonly designated a
“juggler,” the Indians define him as a “revealer of hidden truths.”
There is no association whatever between the members of this profession,
and each practices his art singly and alone whenever a demand is made
and the fee presented. As there is no association, so there is no
initiation by means of which one may become a Jĕs´sakkīd´. The gift is
believed to be given by the thunder god, or Animiki´, and then only at
long intervals and to a chosen few. The gift is received during youth,
when the fast is undertaken and when visions appear to the individual.
His renown depends upon his own audacity and the opinion of the tribe.
He is said to possess the power to look into futurity; to become
acquainted with the affairs and intentions of men; to prognosticate the
success or misfortune of hunters and warriors, as well as other affairs
of various individuals, and to call from any living human being the
soul, or, more strictly speaking, the shadow, thus depriving the victim
of reason, and even of life. His power consists in invoking, and causing
evil, while that of the Midē´ is to avert it; he attempts at times to
injure the Midē´ but the latter, by the aid of his superior man´idos,
becomes aware of, and averts such premeditated injury. It sometimes
happens that the demon possessing a patient is discovered, but the Midē´
alone has the power to expel him. The exorcism of demons is one of the
chief pretensions of this personage, and evil spirits are sometimes
removed

<!--png 206-->
by sucking them through tubes, and startling tales are told how the
Jĕs´sakkīd´ can, in the twinkling of an eye, disengage himself of the
most complicated tying of cords and ropes, etc. The lodge used by this
class of men consists of four poles planted in the ground, forming a
square of three or four feet and upward in diameter, around which are
wrapped birch bark, robes, or canvas in such a way as to form an upright
cylinder. Communion is held with the turtle, who is the most powerful
man´idō of the Jĕs´sakkīd´, and through him, with numerous other
malevolent man´idōs, especially the Animiki´, or thunder-bird. When the
prophet has seated himself within his lodge the structure begins to sway
violently from side to side, loud thumping noises are heard within,
denoting the arrival of man´idōs, and numerous voices and laughter are
distinctly audible to those without. Questions may then be put to the
prophet and, if everything be favorable, the response is not long in
coming. In his notice of the Jĕs´sakkīd´, Schoolcraft affirms<a class =
"tag" href = "#note7" name = "tag7" id = "tag7">7</a> that “while he
thus exercises the functions of a prophet, he is also a member of the
highest class of the fraternity of the Midâwin&mdash;a society of men
who exercise the medical art on the principles of magic and
incantations<ins class = "correction" title =
"close quote missing">.”</ins>
The fact is that there is not the slightest connection
between the practice of the Jĕs´sakkīd´ and that of the Midē´wiwin, and
it is seldom, if at all, that a Midē´ becomes a Jĕs´sakkīd´, although
the latter sometimes gains admission into the Midē´wiwin, chiefly with
the intention of strengthening his power with his tribe.</p>

<p>The number of individuals of this class who are not members of the
Midē´wiwin is limited, though greater than that of the Wâbĕnō´. An idea
of the proportion of numbers of the respective classes may be formed by
taking the case of Menomoni Indians, who are in this respect upon the
same plane as the Ojibwa. That tribe numbers about fifteen hundred, the
Midē´ Society consisting, in round numbers, of one hundred members, and
among the entire population there are but two Wâbĕnō´ and five
Jĕs´sakkīd´.</p>

<p>It is evident that neither the Wâbĕnō´ nor the Jĕs´sakkīd´ confine
themselves to the mnemonic songs which are employed during their
ceremonial performances, or even prepare them to any extent. Such bark
records as have been observed or recorded, even after most careful
research and examination extending over the field seasons of three
years, prove to have been the property of Wâbĕnō´ and Jĕs´sakkīd´, who
were also Midē´. It is probable that those who practice either of the
first two forms of ceremonies and nothing else are familiar with and may
employ for their own information certain mnemonic records; but they are
limited to the characteristic formulæ of exorcism, as their practice
varies and is subject to changes according to circumstances and the
requirements and wants of the applicant when words are chanted to accord
therewith.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">159</span>

<!--png 207-->
Some examples of songs used by Jĕs´sakkīd´, after they have become
Midē´, will be given in the description of the several degrees of the
Midē ’wiwin.</p>

<p>There is still another class of persons termed Mashkī´kĭkē´winĭnĭ, or
herbalists, who are generally denominated “medicine men,” as the Ojibwa
word implies. Their calling is a simple one, and consists in knowing the
mysterious properties of a variety of plants, herbs, roots, and berries,
which are revealed upon application and for a fee. When there is an
administration of a remedy for a given complaint, based upon true
scientific principles, it is only in consequence of such practice having
been acquired from the whites, as it has usually been the custom of the
Catholic Fathers to utilize all ordinary and available remedies for the
treatment of the common disorders of life. Although these herbalists are
aware that certain plants or roots will produce a specified effect upon
the human system, they attribute the benefit to the fact that such
remedies are distasteful and injurious to the demons who are present in
the system and to whom the disease is attributed. Many of these
herbalists are found among women, also; and these, too, are generally
members of the Midē´wiwin. In <a href = "#fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a> is shown
an herbalist preparing a mixture.</p>

The origin of the Midē´wiwin or Midē´ Society, commonly, though
erroneously, termed Grand Medicine Society, is buried in obscurity. In
the Jesuit Relations, as early as 1642, frequent reference is made to
sorcerers, jugglers, and persons whose faith, influence, and practices
are dependent upon the assistance of “Manitous,” or mysterious spirits;
though, as there is no discrimination made between these different
professors of magic, it is difficult positively to determine which of
the several classes were met with at that early day. It is probable that
the Jĕs´sakkīd´, or juggler, and the Midē´, or Shaman, were
referred&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>The Midē´, in the true sense of the word, is a Shaman, though he has
by various authors been termed powwow, medicine man, priest, seer,
prophet, etc. Among the Ojibwa the office is not hereditary; but among
the Menomoni a curious custom exists, by which some one is selected to
fill the vacancy one year after the death of a Shaman. Whether a similar
practice prevailed among other tribes of the Algonkian linguistic stock
can be ascertained only by similar research among the tribes
constituting that stock.</p>

<p>Among the Ojibwa, however, a substitute is sometimes taken to fill
the place of one who has been prepared to receive the first degree of
the Midē´wiwin, or Society of the Midē´, but who is removed by death
before the proper initiation has been conferred. This occurs when a
young man dies, in which case his father or mother may be accepted as a
substitute. This will be explained in more detail under the caption of
Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân or “Ghost Lodge,” a collateral branch of the
Midē´wiwin.</p>

<p>As I shall have occasion to refer to the work of the late Mr.
W.&nbsp;W. Warren, a few words respecting him will not be inappropriate.
Mr. Warren was an Ojibwa mixed blood, of good education, and later a
member of the legislature of Minnesota. His work, entiled “History of
the Ojibwa Nation,” was published in Vol. <span class =
"smallroman">V</span> of the Collections of the Minnesota Historical
Society, St. Paul, 1885, and edited by Dr. E.&nbsp;D. Neill. Mr.
Warren’s work is the result of the labor of a lifetime among his own
people, and, had he lived, he would undoubtedly have added much to the
historical material of which the printed volume chiefly consists. His
manuscript was completed about the year 1852, and he died the following
year. In speaking of the Society of the Midē´,<a class = "tag" href =
"#note8" name = "tag8" id = "tag8">8</a> he says:</p>

<blockquote>The grand rite of Me-da-we-win (or, as we have learned to
term it, “Grand Medicine<ins class = "correction" title =
"close parenthesis missing">,”)</ins>and
the beliefs incorporated therein, are
not yet fully understood by the whites. This important custom is still
shrouded in mystery even to my own eyes, though I have taken much pains
to inquire and made use of every advantage possessed by speaking their
language perfectly, being related to them, possessing their friendship
and intimate confidence has given me, and yet I frankly acknowledge that
I stand as yet, as it were, on the threshold of the Me-da-we lodge. I
believe, however, that I have obtained full as much and more general and
true information
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<a name = "page161" id = "page161"> </a>
<!--png 209-->
on this matter than any other person who has written on the subject, not
excepting a great and standard author, who, to the surprise of many who
know the Ojibways well, has boldly asserted in one of his works that he
has been regularly initiated into the mysteries of this rite, and is a
member of the Me-da-we Society. This is certainly an assertion hard to
believe in the Indian country; and when the old initiators or Indian
priests are told of it they shake their heads in incredulity that a
white man should ever have been allowed <i>in truth</i> to become a
member of their Me-da-we lodge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An entrance into the lodge itself, while the ceremonies are
being enacted, has sometimes been granted through courtesy; though this
does not initiate a person into the mysteries of the creed, nor does it
make him a member of the Society.</blockquote>

<p>These remarks pertaining to the pretensions of “a great and standard
authority” have reference to Mr. Schoolcraft, who among numerous other
assertions makes the following, in the first volume of his Information
Respecting the Indian Tribes of the United States, Philadelphia, 1851,
p. 361, viz:</p>

<blockquote>I had observed the exhibitions of the Medawin, and the
exactness and studious ceremony with which its rites were performed in
1820 in the region of Lake Superior; and determined to avail myself of
the advantages of my official position, in 1822, when I returned as a
Government agent for the tribes, to make further inquiries into its
principles and mode of proceeding. And for this purpose I had its
ceremonies repeated in my office, under the secrecy of closed doors,
with every means of both correct interpretation and of recording the
result. Prior to this transaction I had observed in the hands of an
Indian of the Odjibwa tribe one of those symbolic tablets of pictorial
notation which have been sometimes called “music boards,” from the fact
of their devices being sung off by the initiated of the Meda Society.
This constituted the object of the explanations, which, in accordance
with the positive requisitions of the leader of the society and three
other initiates, was thus ceremoniously made.</blockquote>

<p>This statement is followed by another,<a class = "tag" href =
"#note9" name = "tag9" id = "tag9">9</a> in which Mr. Schoolcraft, in a
foot-note, affirms:</p>

<blockquote>Having in 1823 been myself admitted to the class of a Meda
by the Chippewas, and taken the initiatory step of a <span class =
"smallcaps">Sagima</span> and <span class = "smallcaps">Jesukaid</span>
in each of the other fraternities, and studied their pictographic system
with great care and good helps, I may speak with the more decision on
the subject.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Schoolcraft presents a superficial outline of the initiatory
ceremonies as conducted during his time, but as the description is
meager, notwithstanding that there is every evidence that the ceremonies
were conducted with more completeness and elaborate dramatization nearly
three-quarters of a century ago than at the present day, I shall not
burden this paper with useless repetition, but present the subject as
conducted within the last three years.</p>

<p>Mr. Warren truly says:</p>

<blockquote>In the Me-da-we rite is incorporated most that is ancient
amongst them&mdash;songs and traditions that have descended not orally,
but in hieroglyphs, for at least a long time of generations. In this
rite is also perpetuated the purest and most ancient idioms of their
language, which differs somewhat from that of the common everyday
use.</blockquote>

<p><span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<a name = "page162" id = "page162"> </a>
<!--png 210-->
As the ritual of the Midē´wiwin is based to a considerable extent upon
traditions pertaining to the cosmogony and genesis and to the thoughtful
consideration by the Good Spirit for the Indian, it is looked upon by
them as “their religion,” as they themselves designate&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>In referring to the rapid changes occurring among many of the Western
tribes of Indians, and the gradual discontinuance of aboriginal
ceremonies and customs, Mr. Warren remarks<a class = "tag" href =
"#note10" name = "tag10" id = "tag10">10</a> in reference to the
Ojibwa:</p>

<blockquote>Even among these a change is so rapidly taking place, caused
by a close contact with the white race, that ten years hence it will be
too late to save the traditions of their forefathers from total
oblivion. And even now it is with great difficulty that genuine
information can be obtained of them. Their aged men are fast falling
into their graves, and they carry with them the records of the past
history of their people; they are the initiators of the grand rite of
religious belief which they believe the Great Spirit has granted to his
red children to secure them long life on earth and life hereafter; and
in the bosoms of these old men are locked up the original secrets of
this their most ancient belief.<span class = "pad1">
***</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>They fully believe, and it forms part of their religion,
that the world has once been covered by a deluge, and that we are now
living on what they term the “new earth.” This idea is fully accounted
for by their vague traditions; and in their Me-da-we-win or religion,
hieroglyphs are used to denote this second earth.</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore,</p>

<blockquote>They fully believe that the red man mortally angered the
Great Spirit which caused the deluge, and at the commencement of the new
earth it was only through the medium and intercession of a powerful
being, whom they denominate Manab-o-sho, that they were allowed to
exist, and means were given them whereby to subsist and support life;
and a code of religion was more lately bestowed on them, whereby they
could commune with the offended Great Spirit, and ward off the approach
and ravages of death.</blockquote>

<p>It may be appropriate in this connection to present the description
given by Rev. Peter Jones of the Midē´ priests and priestesses. Mr.
Jones was an educated Ojibwa Episcopal clergyman, and a member of the
Missasauga&mdash;i.e., the Eagle totemic division of that tribe of
Indians living in Canada. In his work<a class = "tag" href = "#note11"
name = "tag11" id = "tag11">11</a> he states:</p>

<blockquote>Each tribe has its medicine men and women&mdash;an order of
priesthood consulted and employed in all times of sickness. These
powwows are persons who are believed to have performed extraordinary
cures, either by the application of roots and herbs or by incantations.
When an Indian wishes to be initiated into the order of a powwow, in the
first place he pays a large fee to the faculty. He is then taken into
the woods, where he is taught the names and virtues of the various
useful plants; next he is instructed how to chant the medicine song, and
how to pray, which prayer is a vain repetition offered up to the Master
of Life, or to some munedoo whom the afflicted imagine they have
offended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The powwows are held in high veneration by their deluded
brethren; not so much for their knowledge of medicine as for the magical
power which they are supposed to possess. It is for their interest to
lead these credulous people to believe that they can at pleasure hold
intercourse with the munedoos, who are ever ready to give them whatever
information they require.</blockquote>

The Ojibwa believe in a multiplicity of spirits, or man´idōs, which
inhabit all space and every conspicuous object in nature. These
man´idōs, in turn, are subservient to superior ones, either of a
charitable and benevolent character or those which are malignant and
aggressive. The chief or superior man´idō is termed Ki´tshi
Man´idō&mdash;Great Spirit&mdash;approaching to a great extent the idea
of the God of the Christian religion; the second in their estimation is
Dzhe Man´idō, a benign being upon whom they look as the guardian spirit
of the Midē´wiwin and through whose divine provision the sacred rites of
the Midē´wiwin were granted to man. The Ani´miki or Thunder God is, if
not the supreme, at least one of the greatest of the malignant man´idōs,
and it is from him that the Jĕs´sakkīd´ are believed to obtain their
powers of evil doing. There is one other, to whom special reference will
be made, who abides in and rules the “place of shadows,” the hereafter;
he is known as Dzhibai´ Man´idō&mdash;Shadow Spirit, or more commonly
Ghost Spirit. The name of Ki´tshi Man´idō is never mentioned but with
reverence, and thus only in connection with the rite of Midē´wiwin, or a
sacred feast, and always after making an offering of tobacco.</p>

<p>The first important event in the life of an Ojibwa youth is his first
fast. For this purpose he will leave his home for some secluded spot in
the forest where he will continue to fast for an indefinite number of
days; when reduced by abstinence from food he enters a hysterical or
ecstatic state in which he may have visions and hallucinations. The
spirits which the Ojibwa most desire to see in these dreams are those of
mammals and birds, though any object, whether animate or inanimate, is
considered a good omen. The object which first appears is adopted as the
personal mystery, guardian spirit, or tutelary daimon of the entranced,
and is never mentioned by him without first making a sacrifice. A small
effigy of this man´idō is made, or its outline drawn upon a small piece
of birch bark, which is carried suspended by a string around the neck,
or if the wearer be a Midē´ he carries it in his “medicine bag” or
pinji´gosân. The future course of life of the faster is governed by his
dream; and it sometimes occurs that because of giving an imaginary
importance to the occurrence, such as beholding, during the trance some
powerful man´idō or other object held in great reverence by the members
of the Midē´ Society, the faster first becomes impressed with the idea
of becoming a Midē´. Thereupon he makes application to a prominent Midē´
priest, and seeks his advice as to the necessary course to be pursued to
attain his desire. If the Midē´ priest considers with favor the
application, he consults with his confrères and action is taken, and the
questions of the requisite preliminary instructions, fees, and presents,
etc., are formally discussed. If the Midē´ priests are in accord with
the desires of the applicant an instructor or preceptor is designated,
to whom he must present himself
<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<a name = "page164" id = "page164"> </a>
<!--png 212-->
and make an agreement as to the amount of preparatory information to be
acquired and the fees and other presents to be given in return. These
fees have nothing whatever to do with the presents which must be
presented to the Midē´ priests previous to his initiation as a member of
the society, the latter being collected during the time that is devoted
to preliminary instruction, which period usually extends over several
years. Thus ample time is found for hunting, as skins and peltries, of
which those not required as presents may be exchanged for blankets,
tobacco, kettles, guns, etc., obtainable from the trader. Sometimes a
number of years are spent in preparation for the first degree of the
Midē´wiwin, and there are many who have impoverished themselves in the
payment of fees and the preparation for the feast to which all visiting
priests are also invited.</p>

<p>Should an Indian who is not prompted by a dream wish to join the
society he expresses to the four chief officiating priests a desire to
purchase a mī´gis, which is the sacred symbol of the society and
consists of a small white shell, to which reference will be made further
on. His application follows the same course as in the preceding
instance, and the same course is pursued also when a Jĕs´sakkīd´ or a
Wâbĕnō´ wishes to become a Midē´.</p>


<h4 class = "section"><a name = "midewiwin" id =
"midewiwin">MIDĒ´WIWIN.</a></h4>

<p>The Midē´wiwin&mdash;Society of the Midē´ or Shamans&mdash;consists
of an indefinite number of Midē´ of both sexes. The society is graded
into four separate and distinct degrees, although there is a general
impression prevailing even among certain members that any degree beyond
the first is practically a mere repetition. The greater power attained
by one in making advancement depends upon the fact of his having
submitted to “being shot at with the medicine sacks” in the hands of the
officiating priests. This may be the case at this late day in certain
localities, but from personal experience it has been learned that there
is considerable variation in the dramatization of the ritual. One
circumstance presents itself forcibly to the careful observer, and that
is that the greater number of repetitions of the phrases chanted by the
Midē´ the greater is felt to be the amount of inspiration and power of
the performance. This is true also of some of the lectures in which
reiteration and prolongation in time of delivery aids very much in
forcibly impressing the candidate and other observers with the
importance and sacredness of the ceremony.</p>

<p>It has always been customary for the Midē´ priests to preserve
birch-bark records, bearing delicate incised lines to represent
pictorially the ground plan of the number of degrees to which the owner

<p>During the year 1887, while at Red Lake, Minnesota, I had the good
fortune to discover the existence of an old birch-bark chart, which,
according to the assurances of the chief and assistant Midē´ priests,
had never before been exhibited to a white man, nor even to an Indian
unless he had become a regular candidate. This chart measures 7 feet 1½
inches in length and 18 inches in width, and is made of five pieces of
birch bark neatly and securely stitched together by means of thin, flat
strands of bass wood. At each end are two thin strips of wood, secured
transversely by wrapping and stitching with thin strands of bark, so as
to prevent splitting and fraying of the ends of the record. <a href =
"#plateIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;A</a>, is a
reproduction of the design referred&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>It had been in the keeping of Skwēkŏ´mĭk, to whom it was intrusted at
the death of his father-in-law, the latter, in turn, having received it
in 1825 from Badâ´san, the Grand Shaman and chief of the Winnibē´goshish
Ojibwa.</p>

<p>It is affirmed that Badâ´san had received the original from the Grand
Midē´ priest at La Pointe, Wisconsin, where, it is said, the <ins class
= "correction" title = "text reads ‘Midê´wiwin’">Midē´wiwin</ins> was at
that time held annually and the ceremonies conducted in strict
accordance with ancient and traditional usage.</p>

<p>The present owner of this record has for many years used it in the
preliminary instruction of candidates. Its value in this respect is very
great, as it presents to the Indian a pictorial résumé of the
traditional history of the origin of the Midē´wiwin, the positions
occupied by the various guardian man´idos in the several degrees, and
the order of procedure in study and progress of the candidate. On
account of the isolation of the Red Lake Indians and their long
continued, independent ceremonial observances, changes have gradually
occurred so that there is considerable variation, both in the pictorial
representation and the initiation, as compared with the records and
ceremonials preserved at other reservations. The reason of this has
already been given.</p>

<p>A detailed description of the above mentioned record, will be
presented further on in connection with two interesting variants which
were subsequently obtained at White Earth, Minnesota. On account of the
widely separated location of many of the different bands of the Ojibwa,
and the establishment of independent Midē´ societies, portions of the
ritual which have been forgotten by one set may be found to survive at
some other locality, though at the expense of some other fragments of
tradition or ceremonial. No satisfactory account of the tradition of the
origin of the Indians has been obtained, but such information as it was
possible to procure will be submitted.</p>

In all of their traditions pertaining to the early history of the tribe
these people are termed A-nish´-in-â´-bēg&mdash;original people&mdash;a
term surviving also among the Ottawa, Patawatomi, and Menomoni,
indicating that the tradition of their westward migration was extant
prior to the final separation of these tribes, which is supposed to have
occurred at Sault Ste. Marie.</p>

<p>Mi´nabō´zho (Great Rabbit), whose name occurs in connection with most
of the sacred rites, was the servant of Dzhe Man´idō, the Good Spirit,
and acted in the capacity of intercessor and mediator. It is generally
supposed that it was to his good offices that the Indian owes life and
the good things necessary to his health and subsistence.</p>

<p>The tradition of Mi´nabō´zho and the origin of the Midē´wiwin, as
given in connection with the birch-bark record obtained at Red Lake (<a
href = "#plateIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;A</a>), is as follows:</p>

<p>When Mi´nabō´zho, the servant of Dzhe Man´idō, looked down upon the
earth he beheld human beings, the Ani´shinâ´bēg, the ancestors of the
Ojibwa. They occupied the four quarters of the earth&mdash;the
northeast, the southeast, the southwest, and the northwest. He saw how
helpless they were, and desiring to give them the means of warding off
the diseases with which they were constantly afflicted, and to provide
them with animals and plants to serve as food and with other comforts,
Mi´nabō´zho remained thoughtfully hovering over the center of the earth,
endeavoring to devise some means of communicating with them, when he
heard something laugh, and perceived a dark object appear upon the
surface of the water to the west (No.&nbsp;2). He could not recognize
its form, and while watching it closely it slowly disappeared from view.
It next appeared in the north (No.&nbsp;3), and after a short lapse of
time again disappeared. Mi´nabō´zho hoped it would again show itself
upon the surface of the water, which it did in the east (No.&nbsp;4).
Then Mi´nabō´zho wished that it might approach him, so as to permit him
to communicate with it. When it disappeared from view in the east and
made its reappearance in the south (No.&nbsp;1), Mi´nabō´zho asked it to
come to the center of the earth that he might behold it. Again it
disappeared from view, and after reappearing in the west Mi´nabō´zho
observed it slowly approaching the center of the earth (i.e., the centre
of the circle), when he descended and saw it was the Otter, now one of
the sacred man´idōs of the Midē´wiwin. Then Mi´nabō´zho instructed the
Otter in the mysteries of the Midē´wiwin, and gave him at the same time
the sacred rattle to be used at the side of the sick; the sacred Midē´
drum to be used during the ceremonial of initiation and at sacred
feasts, and tobacco, to be employed in invocations and in making
peace.</p>

<p>The place where Mi´nabō´zho descended was an island in the middle of
a large body of water, and the Midē´ who is feared by all the others is
called Mini´sino´shkwe (He-who-lives-on-the-island). Then
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167" id = "page167"> </a>
<!--png 217-->
Mi´nabō´zho built a Midē´wigân (sacred Midē´ lodge), and taking his drum
he beat upon it and sang a Midē´ song, telling the Otter that Dzhe
Man´idō had decided to help the Aníshinâ´bōg, that they might always
have life and an abundance of food and other things necessary for their
comfort. Mi´nabō´zho then took the Otter into the Midē´wigân and
conferred upon him the secrets of the Midē´wiwin, and with his Midē´ bag
shot the sacred mī´gis into his body that he might have immortality and
be able to confer these secrets to his kinsmen, the Aníshinâ´bēg.</p>

<p>The mī´gis is considered the sacred symbol of the Midē´wigân, and may
consist of any small white shell, though the one believed to be similar
to the one mentioned in the above tradition resembles the cowrie, and
the ceremonies of initiation as carried out in the Midē´wiwin at this
day are believed to be similar to those enacted by Mi´nabō´zho and the
Otter. It is admitted by all the Midē´ priests whom I have consulted
that much of the information has been lost through the death of their
aged predecessors, and they feel convinced that ultimately all of the
sacred character of the work will be forgotten or lost through the
adoption of new religions by the young people and the death of the Midē´
priests, who, by the way, decline to accept Christian teachings, and are
in consequence termed “pagans.”</p>

<p>My instructor and interpreter of the Red Lake chart added other
information in explanation of the various characters represented
thereon, which I present herewith. The large circle at the right side of
the chart denotes the earth as beheld by Mi´nabō´zho, while the Otter
appeared at the square projections at Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4; the
semicircular appendages between these are the four quarters of the
earth, which are inhabited by the Ani´shinâ´bēg, Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Nos. 9 and 10 represent two of the numerous malignant man´idōs, who
endeavor to prevent entrance into the sacred structure and mysteries of
the Midē´wiwin. The oblong squares, Nos. 11 and 12, represent the
outline of the first degree of the society, the inner corresponding
lines being the course traversed during initiation. The entrance to the
lodge is directed toward the east, the western exit indicating the
course toward the next higher degree. The four human forms at Nos. 13,
14, 15, and 16 are the four officiating Midē´ priests whose services are
always demanded at an initiation. Each is represented as having a
rattle. Nos. 17, 18, and 19 indicate the cedar trees, one of each of
this species being planted near the outer angles of a Midē´ lodge. No.
20 represents the ground. The outline of the bear at No. 21 represents
the Makwa´ Man´idō, or Bear Spirit, one of the sacred Midē´ man´idōs, to
which the candidate must pray and make offerings of tobacco, that he may
compel the malevolent spirits to draw away from the entrance to the
Midē´wigân, which is shown in No. 28. Nos 23 and 24 represent the sacred
drum which
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
<a name = "page168" id = "page168"> </a>
<!--png 218-->
the candidate must use when chanting the prayers, and two offerings must
be made, as indicated by the number two.</p>

<p>After the candidate has been admitted to one degree, and is prepared
to advance to the second, he offers three feasts, and chants three
prayers to the Makwa´ Man´idō, or Bear Spirit (No.&nbsp;22), that the
entrance (No.&nbsp;29) to that degree may be opened to him. The feasts
and chants are indicated by the three drums shown at Nos. 25, 26,
and&nbsp;27.</p>

<p>Nos. 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34 are five Serpent Spirits, evil man´idōs
who oppose a Midē´’s progress, though after the feasting and prayers
directed to the Makwa´ Man´idō have by him been deemed sufficient the
four smaller Serpent Spirits move to either side of the path between the
two degrees, while the larger serpent (No.&nbsp;32) raises its body in
the middle so as to form an arch, beneath which passes the candidate on
his way to the second degree.</p>

<p>Nos. 35, 36, 46, and 47 are four malignant Bear Spirits, who guard
the entrance and exit to the second degree, the doors of which are at
Nos. 37 and 49. The form of this lodge (No.&nbsp;38) is like the
preceding; but while the seven Midē´ priests at Nos. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43,
44, and 45 simply indicate that the number of Midē´ assisting at this
second initiation are of a higher and more sacred class of personages
than in the first degree, the number designated having reference to
quality and intensity rather than to the actual number of assistants, as
specifically shown at the top of the first degree structure.</p>

<p>When the Midē´ is of the second degree, he receives from Dzhe Man´idō
supernatural powers as shown in No. 48. The lines extending upward from
the eyes signify that he can look into futurity; from the ears, that he
can hear what is transpiring at a great distance; from the hands, that
he can touch for good or for evil friends and enemies at a distance,
however remote; while the lines extending from the feet denote his
ability to traverse all space in the accomplishment of his desires or
duties. The small disk upon the breast of the figure denotes that a
Midē´ of this degree has several times had the
mī´gis&mdash;life&mdash;“shot into his body,” the increased size of the
spot signifying amount or quantity of influence obtained thereby.</p>

<p>No. 50 represents a Mi´tsha Midē´ or Bad Midē´, one who employs his
powers for evil purposes. He has the power of assuming the form of any
animal, in which guise he may destroy the life of his victim,
immediately after which he resumes his human form and appears innocent
of any crime. His services are sought by people who wish to encompass
the destruction of enemies or rivals, at however remote a locality the
intended victim may be at the time. An illustration representing the
modus operandi of his performance is reproduced and explained in <a href
= "#fig24">Fig. 24</a>, page 238.</p>

<p>Persons possessed of this power are sometimes termed witches, special
reference to whom is made elsewhere. The illustration, No.
<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
<a name = "page169" id = "page169"> </a>
<!--png 219-->
50, represents such an individual in his disguise of a bear, the
characters at Nos. 51 and 52 denoting footprints of a bear made by him,
impressions of which are sometimes found in the vicinity of lodges
occupied by his intended victims. The trees shown upon either side of
No. 50 signify a forest, the location usually sought by bad Midē´ and
witches.</p>

<p>If a second degree Midē´ succeeds in his desire to become a member of
the third degree, he proceeds in a manner similar to that before
described; he gives feasts to the instructing and four officiating
Midē´, and offers prayers to Dzhe Man´idō for favor and success. No. 53
denotes that the candidate now personates the bear&mdash;not one of the
malignant man´idōs, but one of the sacred man´idōs who are believed to
be present during the ceremonials of initiation of the second degree. He
is seated before his sacred drum, and when the proper time arrives the
Serpent Man´idō (No.&nbsp;54)&mdash;who has until this opposed his
advancement&mdash;now arches its body, and beneath it he crawls and
advances toward the door (No.&nbsp;55) of the third degree (No.&nbsp;56)
of the Midē´wiwin, where he encounters two (Nos. 57 and&nbsp;58) of the
four Panther Spirits, the guardians of this degree.</p>

<p>Nos. 61 to 76 indicate midē´ spirits who inhabit the structure of
this degree, and the number of human forms in excess of those shown in
connection with the second degree indicates a correspondingly higher and
more sacred character. When an Indian has passed this, initiation he
becomes very skillful in his profession of a Midē´. The powers which he
possessed in the second degree may become augmented. He is represented
in No. 77 with arms extended, and with lines crossing his body and arms
denoting darkness and obscurity, which signifies his ability to grasp
from the invisible world the knowledge and means to accomplish
extraordinary deeds. He feels more confident of prompt response and
assistance from the sacred man´idōs and his knowledge of them becomes
more widely extended.</p>

<p>Nos. 59 and 60 are two of the four Panther Spirits who are the
special guardians of the third degree lodge.</p>

<p>To enter the fourth and highest degree of the society requires a
greater number of feasts than before, and the candidate, who continues
to personate the Bear Spirit, again uses his sacred drum, as he is shown
sitting before it in No. 78, and chants more prayers to Dzhe Man´idō for
his favor. This degree is guarded by the greatest number and the most
powerful of malevolent spirits, who make a last effort to prevent a
candidate’s entrance at the door (No.&nbsp;79) of the fourth degree
structure (No.&nbsp;80). The chief opponents to be overcome, through the
assistance of Dzhe Man´idō, are two Panther Spirits (Nos. 81
and&nbsp;82) at the eastern entrance, and two Bear Spirits (Nos. 83
and&nbsp;84) at the western exit. Other bad spirits are about the
structure, who frequently gain possession and are then enabled to make
strong and prolonged resistance to the candidate’s entrance.
<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
<a name = "page170" id = "page170"> </a>
<!--png 220-->
The chiefs of this group of malevolent beings are Bears (Nos. 88
and&nbsp;96), the Panther (No.&nbsp;91), the Lynx (No.&nbsp;97), and
many others whose names they have forgotten, their positions being
indicated at Nos. 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, and 95, all but the
last resembling characters ordinarily employed to designate
serpents.</p>

<p>The power with which it is possible to become endowed after passing
through the fourth degree is expressed by the outline of a human figure
(No.&nbsp;98), upon which are a number of spots indicating that the body
is covered with the mī´gis or sacred shells, symbolical of the
Midē´wiwin. These spots designate the places where the Midē´ priests,
during the initiation, shot into his body the mī´gis and the lines
connecting them in order that all the functions of the several
corresponding parts or organs of the body may be exercised.</p>

<p>The ideal fourth degree Midē´ is presumed to be in a position to
accomplish the greatest feats in necromancy and magic. He is not only
endowed with the power of reading the thoughts and intentions of others,
as is pictorially indicated by the mī´gis spot upon the top of the head,
but to call forth the shadow (soul) and retain it within his grasp at
pleasure. At this stage of his pretensions, he is encroaching upon the
prerogatives of the Jĕs´sakkīd´, and is then recognized as one, as he
usually performs within the Jĕs´sakkân or Jĕs´sakkīd´ lodge, commonly
designated “the Jugglery.”</p>

<p>The ten small circular objects upon the upper part of the record may
have been some personal marks of the original owner; their import was
not known to my informants and they do not refer to any portion of the
history or ceremonies or the Midē´wiwin.</p>

<p>Extending toward the left from the end of the fourth degree inclosure
is an angular pathway (No.&nbsp;99), which represents the course to be
followed by the Midē´ after he has attained this high distinction. On
account of his position his path is often beset with dangers, as
indicated by the right angles, and temptations which may lead him
astray; the points at which he may possibly deviate from the true course
of propriety are designated by projections branching off obliquely
toward the right and left (No. 100). The ovoid figure (No. 101) at the
end of this path is termed Wai-ĕk´-ma-yŏk´&mdash;End of the
road&mdash;and is alluded to in the ritual, as will be observed
hereafter, as the end of the world, i.e., the end of the individual’s
existence. The number of vertical strokes (No. 102) within the ovoid
figure signify the original owner to have been a fourth degree Midē´ for
a period of 14 years.</p>

<p>The outline of the Midē´wigân (No. 103) not only denotes that the
same individual was a member of the Midē´wiwin, but the thirteen
vertical strokes shown in Nos. 104 and 105 indicate that he was chief
Midē´ priest of the society for that number of years.</p>

<p>The outline of a Midē´wigân as shown at No. 106, with the place upon
the interior designating the location of the sacred post (No.
<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
<a name = "page171" id = "page171"> </a>
<!--png 223-->
107) and the stone (No. 108) against which the sick are placed during
the time of treatment, signifies the owner to have practiced his calling
of the exorcism of demons. But that he also visited the sick beyond the
acknowledged jurisdiction of the society in which he resided, is
indicated by the path (No. 109) leading around the sacred inclosure.</p>

<p>Upon that portion of the chart immediately above the fourth degree
lodge is shown the outline of a Midē´wiwin (No. 110), with a path (No.
114), leading toward the west to a circle (No. 111), within which is
another similar structure (No. 112) whose longest diameter is at right
angles to the path, signifying that it is built so that its entrance is
at the north. This is the Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân or Ghost Lodge.</p>

<p>Around the interior of the circle are small V-shaped characters
denoting the places occupied by the spirits of the departed, who are
presided over by the Dzhibai´ Midē´, literally Shadow Midē´.</p>

<p>No. 113 represents the Kŏ´-kó-kŏ-ō´ (Owl) passing from the Midē´wigân
to the Land of the Setting Sun, the place of the dead, upon the road of
the dead, indicated by the pathway at No. 114. This man´idō is
personated by a candidate for the first degree of the Midē´wiwin when
giving a feast to the dead in honor of the shadow of him who had been
dedicated to the Midē´wiwin and whose place is now to be taken by the
giver of the feast.</p>

<p>Upon the back of the Midē´ record, above described, is the personal
record of the original owner, as shown in <a href = "#plateIII">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;B</a>. Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4
represent the four degrees of the society into which he has been
initiated, or, to use the phraseology of an Ojibwa, “through which he
has gone.” This “passing through” is further illustrated by the bear
tracks, he having personated the Makwa´ Man´idō or Bear Spirit,
considered to be the highest and most powerful of the guardian spirits
of the fourth degree wigwam.</p>

<p>The illustration presented in <a href = "#plateIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;C</a> represents the outlines of a
birch-bark record (reduced to one-third) found among the effects of a
lately deceased Midē´ from Leech Lake, Minnesota. This record, together
with a number of other curious articles, composed the outfit of the
Midē´, but the Rev. James A. Gilfillan of White Earth, through whose
courtesy I was permitted to examine the objects, could give me no
information concerning their use. Since that time, however, I have had
an opportunity of consulting with one of the chief priests of the Leech
Lake Society, through whom I have obtained some interesting data
concerning them.</p>

<p>The chart represents the owner to have been a Midē´ of the second
degree, as indicated by the two outlines of the respective structures at
Nos. 1 and 2, the place of the sacred posts being marked at Nos. 3 and
4. Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8 are Midē´ priests holding their Midē´ bags as in
the ceremony of initiation. The disks represented at Nos.

9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 denote the sacred drum, which may be used by him
during his initiation, while Nos. 14, 15, 16, and 17 denote that he was
one of the four officiating priests of the Midē´wigân at his place of
residence. Each of these figures is represented as holding their sacred
bags as during the ceremonies. No. 18 denotes the path he has been
pursuing since he became a Midē´, while at Nos. 19 and 20 diverging
lines signify that his course is beset with temptations and enemies, as
referred to in the description of the Red Lake chart, <a href =

received continued instruction from his father Baiē´dzhĕk, and although
he never publicly received advancement beyond the second degree of the
society, his wife became a fourth degree priestess, at whose initiation
he was permitted to be present.</p>

<p>Since his residence at White Earth Sikas´sigĕ has become one of the
officiating priests of the society at that place. One version given by
him of the origin of the Indians is presented in the following
tradition, a pictorial representation having also been prepared of which
<a href = "#plateV">Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">V</span></a> is
a reduced copy:</p>

<blockquote>In the beginning, Dzhe Man´idō (No.&nbsp;1), made the Midē´
Man´idōs. He first created two men (Nos. 2 and&nbsp;3), and two women
(Nos. 4 and&nbsp;5); but they had no power of thought or reason. Then
Dzhe Man´idō (No.&nbsp;1) made them rational beings. He took them in his
hands so that they should multiply; he paired them, and from this sprung
the Indians. When there were people he placed them upon the earth, but
he soon observed that they were subject to sickness, misery, and death,
and that unless he provided them with the Sacred Medicine they would
soon become extinct.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Between the position occupied by Dzhe Man´idō and the earth
were four lesser spirits (Nos. 6, 7, 8, and&nbsp;9) with whom Dzhe
Man´idō decided to commune, and to impart to them the mysteries by which
the Indians could be benefited. So he first spoke to a spirit at No. 6,
and told him all he had to say, who in turn communicated the same
information to No. 7, and he in turn to No. 8, who also communed with
No. 9. They all met in council, and determined to call in the four wind
gods at Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13. After consulting as to what would be
best for the comfort and welfare of the Indians, these spirits agreed to
ask Dzhe Man´idō to communicate the Mystery of the Sacred Medicine to
the people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dzhe Man´idō then went to the Sun Spirit (No.&nbsp;14) and
asked him to go to the earth and instruct the people as had been decided
upon by the council. The Sun Spirit, in the form of a little boy, went

of her own.</blockquote>

winter this woman’s

son died. The parents were so much distressed that they decided to
return to the village and bury the body there; so they made preparations
to return, and as they traveled along, they would each evening erect
several poles upon which the body was placed to prevent the wild beasts
from devouring it. When the dead boy was thus hanging upon the poles,
the adopted child&mdash;who was the Sun Spirit&mdash;would play about
the camp and amuse himself, and finally told his adopted father he
pitied him, and his mother, for their sorrow. The adopted son said he
could bring his dead brother to life, whereupon the parents expressed
great surprise and desired to know how that could be
accomplished.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The adopted boy then had the party hasten to the village,
when he said, “Get the women to make a wig´iwam of bark (No.&nbsp;16),
put the dead boy in a covering of birch bark and place the body on the
ground in the middle of the wig´iwam<ins class = "correction" title =

done, the family and friends went into this lodge and seated themselves
around the corpse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When they had all been sitting quietly for some time, they
saw through the doorway the approach of a bear (No.&nbsp;17) which
gradually came towards the wig´iwam, entered it, and placed itself
before the dead body and said hŭ, hŭ, hŭ, hŭ, when he passed around it
towards the left side, with a trembling motion, and as he did so, the
body began quivering, and the quivering increased as the bear continued
until he had passed around four times, when the body came to life again
and stood up. Then the bear called to the father, who was sitting in the
distant right-hand corner of the wig´iwam, and addressed to him the
following words:</blockquote>

gē-wī-nĭp&mdash;“Little-boy-his-work.”</p>

<p>From subsequent information it was learned that the line No. 22
denotes the earth, and that, being considered as one step in the course
of initiation into the Midē´wiwin, three others must be taken before a
candidate can be admitted. These steps, or rests, as they are
denominated (Nos. 23, 24, and&nbsp;25), are typified by four distinct
gifts of goods, which must be remitted to the Midē´ priests before the
ceremony can take place.</p>

<p>Nos. 18 and 19 are repetitions of the figures alluded to in the
tradition (Nos. 16 and&nbsp;17) to signify that the candidate must
personate the Makwa´ Man´idō&mdash;Bear Spirit&mdash;when entering the
Midē´wiwin (No.&nbsp;19). No. 20 is the Midē´ Man´idō as Ki´tshi Man´idō
is termed

by the Midē´ priests. The presence of horns attached to the head is a
common symbol of superior power found in connection with the figures of
human and divine forms in many Midē´ songs and other mnemonic records.
No. 21 represents the earth’s surface, similar to that designated at
No.&nbsp;22.</p>

<p>Upon comparing the preceding tradition of the creation of the Indians
with the following, which pertains to the descent to earth of
Mi´nabō´zho, there appears to be some discrepancy, which could not be
explained by Sikas´sigĕ, because he had forgotten the exact sequence of
events; but from information derived from other Midē´ it is evident that
there have been joined together two myths, the intervening circumstances
being part of the tradition given below in connection with the narrative
relating to the chart on <a href = "#plateIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;A</a>.</p>

<p>This chart, which was in possession of the Mille Lacs chief
Baiē´dzhĕk, was copied by him from that belonging to his preceptor at La
Pointe about the year 1800, and although the traditions given by
Sikas´sigĕ is similar to the one surviving at Red Lake, the diagram is
an interesting variant for the reason that there is a greater amount of
detail in the delineation of objects mentioned in the tradition.</p>

<p>By referring to <a href = "#plateIV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">IV</span></a> it will be noted that the circle, No. 1,
resembles the corresponding circle at the beginning of the record on <a
href = "#plateIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">III</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, with this difference, that the four
quarters of the globe inhabited by the Ani´shinâ´bēg are not designated
between the cardinal points at which the Otter appeared, and also that
the central island, only alluded to there (<a href = "#plateIII">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;A</a>), is here inserted.</p>

<p>The correct manner of arranging the two pictorial records, Pls. <span

(<a href = "#plateV">Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">V</span></a>,
No.&nbsp;21) upon the island indicated in <a href =
"#plateIV">Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">IV</span></a>, No. 6, so
that the former stands vertically and at right angles to the latter; for
the reason that the first half of the tradition pertains to the
consultation held between Ki´tshi Man´idō and the four lesser spirits
which is believed to have occurred above the earth’s surface. According
to Sikas´sigĕ the two charts should be joined as suggested in the
accompanying illustration, <a href = "#fig2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>.</p>

<!--png 231-->
Sikas´sigĕ’s explanation of the Mille Lacs chart (<a href =
"#plateIV">Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">IV</span></a>) is
substantially as follows:</p>

<blockquote>When Mi´nabō´zho descended to the earth to give to the
Ani´shinâ´bēg the Midē´wiwin, he left with them this chart,
Midē´wigwas´. Ki´tshi Man´idō saw that his people on earth were without
the means of protecting themselves against disease and death, so he sent
Mi´nabō´zho to give to them the sacred gift. Mi´nabō´zho appeared over
the waters and while reflecting in what manner he should be able to
communicate with the people, he heard something laugh, just as an otter
sometimes cries out. He saw something black appear upon the waters in
the west (No.&nbsp;2) which immediately disappeared beneath the surface
again. Then it came up at the northern horizon (No.&nbsp;3), which
pleased Mi´nabō´zho, as he thought he now had some one through whom he
might convey the information with which he had been charged by Ki´tshi
Man´idō. When the black object disappeared beneath the waters at the
north to reappear in the east (No.&nbsp;4), Mi´nabō´zho desired it would
come to him in the middle of the waters, but it disappeared to make its
reappearance in the south (No.&nbsp;5), where it again sank out of sight
to reappear in the west (No.&nbsp;2), when Mi´nabō´zho asked it to
approach the center where there was an island (No.&nbsp;6), which it
did. This did Ni´gĭk, the Otter, and for this reason he is given charge
of the first degree of the Midē´wiwin (Nos. 35 and&nbsp;36) where his
spirit always abides during initiation and when healing the
sick.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then Ni´gĭk asked Mi´nabō´zho, “Why do you come to this
place?” When the latter said, “I have pity on the Ani´shinâ´bēg and wish
to give them life; Ki´tshi Man´idō gave me the power to confer upon them
the means of protecting themselves against sickness and death, and
through you I will give them the Midē´wiwin, and teach them the sacred
rites.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then Mi´nabō´zho built a Midē´wigân in which he instructed
the Otter in all the mysteries of the Midē´wiwin. The Otter sat before
the door of the Midē´wigân four days (Nos. 7, 8, 9, and&nbsp;10),
sunning himself, after which time he approached the entrance
(No.&nbsp;14), where his progress was arrested (No.&nbsp;11) by seeing
two bad spirits (Nos. 12 and&nbsp;13) guarding it. Through the powers
possessed by Mi´nabō´zho he was enabled to pass these; when he entered
the sacred lodge (No.&nbsp;15), the first object he beheld being the
sacred stone (No.&nbsp;16) against which those who were sick were to be
seated, or laid, when undergoing the ceremonial of restoring them to
health. He next saw a post (No.&nbsp;17) painted red with a green band
around the top. A sick man would also have to pray
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
<a name = "page176" id = "page176"> </a>
<!--png 232-->
to the stone and to the post, when he is within the Midē´wigân, because
within them would be the Midē´ spirits whose help he invoked. The Otter
was then taken to the middle of the Midē´wigân where he picked up the
mī´gis (No.&nbsp;18) from among a heap of sacred objects which form part
of the gifts given by Ki´tshi Man´idō. The eight man´idōs around the
midē´wigân (Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and&nbsp;26) were also sent
by Ki´tshi Man´idō to guard the lodge against the entrance of bad
spirits.</blockquote>

<p>A life is represented by the line No. 27, the signification of the
short lines (Nos. 28, 29, 30, and&nbsp;31) denoting that the course of
human progress is beset by temptations and trials which may be the cause
of one’s departure from such course of conduct as is deemed proper, and
the beliefs taught by the Midē´. When one arrives at middle age
(No.&nbsp;32) his course for the remaining period of life is usually
without any special events, as indicated by the plain line No. 27,
extending from middle age (No.&nbsp;32) to the end of one’s existence
(No.&nbsp;33). The short lines at Nos. 28, 29, 30, and 31, indicating
departure from the path of propriety, terminate in rounded spots and
signify, literally, “lecture places,” because when a Midē´ feels himself
failing in duty or vacillating in faith he must renew professions by
giving a feast and lecturing to his confreres, thus regaining his
strength to resist evil doing&mdash;such as making use of his powers in
harming his kinsmen, teaching that which was not given him by Ki´tshi
Man´idō through Mi´nabō´zho, etc. His heart must be cleansed and his
tongue guarded.</p>

<p>To resume the tradition of the course pursued by the Otter,
Sikas´sigĕ said:</p>

<blockquote>The Otter then went round the interior of the Midē´wigân
(No.&nbsp;34), and finally seated himself in the west, where Mi´nabō´zho
shot into his body the sacred mī´gis, which was in his Midē´ bag. Then
Mi´nabō´zho said, “This is your lodge and you shall own it always (Nos.
35 and&nbsp;36), and eight Midē´ Man´idōs (Nos. 19-26) <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘shal’">shall</ins> guard it during the
night.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Otter was taken to the entrance (No.&nbsp;37) of the
second degree structure (No.&nbsp;38), which he saw was guarded by two
evil man´idōs (Nos. 39 and&nbsp;40), who opposed his progress, but who
were driven away by Mi´nabō´zho. When the Otter entered at the door he
beheld the sacred stone (No.&nbsp;41) and two posts (Nos. 42,&nbsp;43),
the one nearest to him being painted red with a green band around the
top, and another at the middle, with a bunch of little feathers upon the
top. The other post (No.&nbsp;43) was painted red, with only a band of
green at the top, similar to the first degree post. Nos. 44 and 45 are
the places where sacred objects and gifts are placed. This degree of the
Midē´wiwin is guarded at night by twelve Midē´ Man´idōs (Nos. 46
to&nbsp;57) placed there by Ki´tshi Man´idō, and the degree is owned by
the Thunder Bird as shown in Nos. 58,&nbsp;59.</blockquote>

<p>The circles (Nos. 60, 61, and&nbsp;62) at either end of the outline
of the structure denoting the degree and beneath it are connected by a
line (No.&nbsp;63) as in the preceding degree, and are a mere repetition
to denote the course of conduct to be pursued by the Midē´. The points
(Nos. 64, 65, 66, and&nbsp;67), at the termini of the shorter lines,
also refer to the feasts and lectures to be given in case of need.</p>

To continue the informant’s tradition:</p>

<blockquote>When the Otter had passed around the interior of the
Midē´wigân four times, he seated himself in the west and faced the
degree post, when Mi´nabō´zho again shot into his body the mī´gis, which
gave him renewed life. Then the Otter was told to take a “sweat bath”
once each day for four successive days, so as to prepare for the next
degree. (This number is indicated at the rounded spots at Nos. 68, 69,
70, and&nbsp;71.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The third degree of the Midē´wiwin (No.&nbsp;72) is guarded
during the day by two Midē´ spirits (Nos. 73,&nbsp;74) near the eastern
entrance, and by the Makwa´ Man´idō within the inclosure (Nos. 75
and&nbsp;76), and at night by eighteen Midē´ Man´idōs (Nos. 77
to&nbsp;94), placed there by Ki´tshi Man´idō. When the Otter approached
the entrance (No.&nbsp;95) he was again arrested in his progress by two
evil man´idōs (Nos. 96 and&nbsp;97), who opposed his admission, but
Mi´nibō´zho overcame them and the Otter entered. Just inside of the
door, and on each side, the Otter saw a post (Nos. 98 and&nbsp;99), and
at the western door or exit two corresponding posts (Nos. 100 and 101).
These symbolized the four legs of the Makwa´ Man´idō, or Bear Spirit,
who is the guardian by day and the owner of the third degree. The Otter
then observed the sacred stone (No. 102) and the two heaps of sacred
objects (Nos. 103 and 104) which Mi´nabō´zho had deposited, and three
degree posts (Nos. 105, 106, and 107), the first of which (No. 105) was
a plain cedar post with the bark upon it, but sharpened at the top; the
second (No. 106), a red post with a green band round the top and one
about the middle, as in the second degree; and the third a cross (No.
107) painted red, each of the tips painted green. [The vertical line No.
108 was said to have no relation to anything connected with the
tradition.] After the Otter had observed the interior of the Midē´wigân
he again made four circuits, after which he took his station in the
west, where he seated himself, facing the sacred degree posts. Then
Mi´nabō´zho, for the third time, shot into his body the mī´gis, thus
adding to the powers which he already possessed, after which he was to
prepare for the fourth degree of the Midē´wiwin.</blockquote>

<p>Other objects appearing upon the chart were subsequently explained as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>The four trees (Nos. 109, 110, 111, and 112), one of which
is planted at each of the four corners of the Midē´wigân, are usually
cedar, though pine may be taken as a substitute when the former can not
be had. The repetition of the circles Nos. 113, 114, and 115 and
connecting line No. 116, with the short lines at Nos. 117, 118, 119, and
120, have the same signification as in the preceding two
degrees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the Otter had received the third degree he prepared
himself for the fourth, and highest, by taking a steam bath once a day
for four successive days (Nos. 121, 122, 123, and 124). Then, as he
proceeded toward the Midē´wigân he came to a wig´iwam made of brush (No.
179), which was the nest of Makwa´ Man´idō, the Bear Spirit, who guarded
the four doors of the sacred structure.</blockquote>

<p>The four rows of spots have reference to the four entrances of the
Midē´wigân of the fourth degree. The signification of the spots near the
larger circle, just beneath the “Bear’s nest” could not be explained by
Sikas´sigĕ, but the row of spots (No. 117) along the horizontal line
leading to the entrance of the inclosure were denominated steps, or
stages of progress, equal to as many days&mdash;one spot denoting one
day&mdash;which must elapse before the Otter was permitted to view the
entrance.</p>

<blockquote>When the Otter approached the fourth degree (No. 118) he
came to a short post
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178" id = "page178"> </a>
<!--png 234-->
(No. 119) in which there was a small aperture. The post was painted
green on the side from which he approached and red upon the side toward
the Midē´wigân [see <a href = "#fig4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>.] But before he
was permitted to look through it he rested and invoked the favor of
Ki´tshi Man´idō, that the evil man´idōs might be expelled from his path.
Then, when the Otter looked through the post, he saw that the interior
of the inclosure was filled with Midē´ Man´idos, ready to receive him
and to attend during his initiation. The two Midē´ Man´idos at the
outside of the eastern entrance (Nos. 120 and 121) compelled the evil
man´idōs (Nos. 122 and 123) to depart and permit the Otter to enter at
the door (No. 124). Then the Otter beheld the sacred stone (No. 125) and
the five heaps of sacred objects which <ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original: word is usually written ‘Mi´nabō´zho’">Minabō´zho</ins>
had deposited (Nos. 126, 127, 128, 129, and 130) near the four degree
posts (Nos. 131, 132, 133, and 134). According to their importance, the
first was painted red, with a green band about the top; the second was
painted red, with two green bands, one at the top and another at the
middle; the third consisted of a cross painted red, with the tips of the
arms and the top of the post painted green; while the fourth was a
square post, the side toward the east being painted white, that toward
the south green, that toward the west red, and that toward the north
black.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The two sets of sticks (Nos. 135 and 136) near the eastern
and western doors represent the legs of Makwa´ Man´idō, the Bear Spirit.
When the Otter had observed all these things he passed round the
interior of the Midē´wigân four times, after which he seated himself in
the west, facing the degree posts, when Mi´nabō´zho approached him and
for the fourth time shot into his body the sacred mī´gis, which gave him
life that will endure always. Then Mi´nabō´zho said to the Otter, “This
degree belongs to Ki´tshi Man´ido, the Great Spirit (Nos. 137 and 138),
who will always be present when you give the sacred rite to any of your
people.” At night the Midē´ Man´idōs (Nos. 139 to 162) will guard the
Midē´wigân, as they are sent by Ki´tshi Man´ido to do so. The Bear’s
nest (Nos. 163 and 164) just beyond the northern and southern doors
(Nos. 165 and 166) of the Midē´wigân are the places where Makwa´ Man´idō
takes his station when guarding the doors.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the Otter made a wig´iwam and offered four prayers
(Nos. 167, 168, 169, and 170) for the rites of the Midē´wiwin, which
Ki´tshi Man´idō had given him.</blockquote>

<p>The following supplemental explanations were added by Sikas´sigĕ,
viz: The four vertical lines at the outer angles of the lodge structure
(Nos. 171, 172, 173, and 174), and four similar ones on the inner
corners (Nos. 175, 176, 177, and 178), represent eight cedar trees
planted there by the Midē´ at the time of preparing the Midē´wigân for
the reception of candidates. The circles Nos. 179, 180, and 181, and the
connecting line, are a reproduction of similar ones shown in the three
preceding degrees, and signify the course of a Midē’s life&mdash;that it
should be without fault and in strict accordance with the teachings of
the Midē´wiwin. The short lines, terminating in circles Nos. 182, 183,
184, and 185, allude to temptations which beset the Midē’s path, and he
shall, when so tempted, offer at these points feasts and lectures, or,
in other words, “professions of faith.” The three lines Nos. 186, 187,
and 188, consisting of four

spots each, which radiate from the larger circle at No. 179 and that
before mentioned at No. 116, symbolize the four bear nests and their
respective approaches, which are supposed to be placed opposite the four
doors of the fourth degree; and it is obligatory, therefore, for a
candidate to enter these four doors on hands and knees when appearing
for his initiation and before he finally waits to receive the concluding
portion of the ceremony.</p>

<p>The illustration presented in <a href = "#fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a> is a
reduced copy of a drawing made by Sikas´sigĕ to represent the migration
of the Otter toward the west after he had received the rite of the
Midē´wiwin. No. 1 refers to the circle upon the large chart on <a href =
"#plateIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">III</span></a> in A, No. 1,
and signifies the earth’s surface as before described. No. 2 in <a href
= "#fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a> is a line separating the history of the
Midē´wiwin from that of the migration as follows: When the Otter had
offered four prayers, as above mentioned, which fact is referred to by
the spot No. 3, he disappeared beneath the surface of the water and went
toward the west, whither the Ani´shinâ´bēg followed him, and located at
Ottawa Island (No.&nbsp;4). Here they erected the Midē´wigân and lived
for many years. Then the Otter again disappeared beneath the water, and
in a short time reappeared at A´wiat´ang (No.&nbsp;5), when the
Midē´wigân was again erected and the sacred rites conducted in
accordance with the teachings of Mi´nabō´zho. Thus was an interrupted
migration continued, the several resting places being given below in
their proper order, at each of which the rites of the Midē´wiwin were
conducted in all their purity. The next place to locate at was

<p>This last-named locality is said to be Sandy Lake, Minnesota, where
the Otter appeared for the last time, and where the Midē´wigân was
finally located. From La Pointe, as well as from Sandy Lake, the Ojibwa
claim to have dispersed in bands over various portions of the territory,
as well as into Wisconsin, which final separation into distinct bodies
has been the chief cause of the gradual changes found to exist in the
ceremonies of the Midē´wiwin.</p>

Plate VI. Ojibwa Facial Decoration.</p>

<p>According to Sikas´sigĕ, the above account of the initiation of the
Otter, by Mi´nabo´zho, was adopted as the course of initiation by the
Midē´ priests of the Mille Lacs Society, when he himself received the
first degree, 1830. At that time a specific method of facial decoration
was pursued by the priests of the respective degrees (<a href =
"#plateVI">Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">VI</span></a>), each
adopting that pertaining to the highest degree to which he was entitled,
viz:</p>

<p><i>First degree.</i>&mdash;A broad band of green across the forehead
and a narrow stripe of vermilion across the face, just below the
eyes.</p>

<p><i>Second degree.</i>&mdash;A narrow stripe of vermilion across the
temples, the eyelids, and the root of the nose, a short distance above
which is a similar stripe of green, then another of vermilion, and above
this again one of green.</p>

<p><i>Third degree.</i>&mdash;Red and white spots are daubed all over
the face, the spots being as large as can be made by the finger tips in
applying the colors.</p>

<p><i>Fourth degree.</i>&mdash;Two forms of decoration were admissible;
for the first, the face was painted with vermilion, with a stripe of
green extending diagonally across it from the upper part of the left
temporal region to the lower part of the right cheek; for the second,
the face was painted red with two short, horizontal parallel bars of
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>

green across the forehead. Either of these was also employed as a sign
of mourning by one whose son has been intended for the priesthood of the
Midē´wiwin, but special reference to this will be given in connection
with the ceremony of the Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân, or Ghost Society.</p>

<p>On <a href = "#plateVIII">Pl.&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">VIII</span></a> is presented a reduced copy of the Midē´
chart made by Ojibwa, a Midē´ priest of the fourth degree and formerly a
member of the society of the Sandy Lake band of the Mississippi Ojibwa.
The illustration is copied from his own chart which he received in 1833
in imitation of that owned by his father, Me´toshi´kō<sup>n</sup>sh; and
this last had been received from Lake Superior, presumably La Pointe,
many years before.</p>

<p>The illustration of the four degrees are here represented in profile,
and shows higher artistic skill than the preceding copies from Red Lake,
and Mille Lacs.</p>

<p>The information given by Ojibwa, regarding the characters is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>When Ki´tshi Man´idō had decided to give to the
Ani´shinâ´bēg the rites of the Midē´wiwin, he took his Midē´ drum and
sang, calling upon the other Man´idōs <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘to to’">to</ins> join him and to hear what he was going to
do. No. 1 represents the abode in the sky of Ki´tshi Man´idō, No. 2,
indicating the god as he sits drumming, No. 3. the small spots
surrounding the drum denoting the mī´gis with which everything about him
is covered. The Midē´ Man´idōs came to him in his Midē´wigân
(No.&nbsp;4), eleven of which appear upon the inside of that structure,
while the ten&mdash;all but himself&mdash;upon the outside (Nos. 5
to&nbsp;14) are represented as descending to the earth, charged with the
means of conferring upon the Ani´shinâbē´g the sacred rite. In the
Midē´wigân (No.&nbsp;4) is shown also the sacred post (No.&nbsp;15) upon
which is perched Kŏ-ko´kŏ-ō&mdash;the Owl (No.&nbsp;16). The line
traversing the structure, from side to side, represents the trail
leading through it, while the two rings (Nos. 17 and&nbsp;18) upon the
right side of the post indicate respectively the spot where the presents
are deposited and the sacred stone&mdash;this according to modern
practices.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When an Indian is prepared to receive the rights of
initiation he prepares a wig´iwam (No.&nbsp;19) in which he takes a
steam bath once each day for four successive days. The four baths and
four days are indicated by the number of spots at the floor of the
lodge, representing stones. The instructors, employed by him, and the
officiating priests of the society are present, one of which
(No.&nbsp;20) may be observed upon the left of the wig´iwam in the act
of making an offering of smoke, while the one to the right (No.&nbsp;21)
is drumming and singing. The four officiating priests are visible to
either side of the candidate within the structure. The wig´iwams (Nos.
22, 23, 24, and&nbsp;25) designate the village habitations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the evening of the day preceding the initiation, the
candidate (No.&nbsp;26) visits his instructor (No.&nbsp;27) to receive
from him final directions as to the part to be enacted upon the
following day. The candidate is shown in the act of carrying with him
his pipe, the offering of tobacco being the most acceptable of all
gifts. His relatives follow and carry the goods and other presents, some
of which are suspended from the branches of the Midē´ tree (No.&nbsp;28)
near the entrance of the first degree structure. The instructor’s
wig´iwam is shown at No. 29, the two dark circular spots upon the floor
showing two of the seats, occupied by instructor and pupil. The figure
No. 27 has his left arm elevated, denoting that his conversation
pertains to Ki´tshi Man´idō, while in his right hand he holds his Midē´
drum. Upon the following
<span class = "pagenum">182</span>

<!--png 240-->
morning the Midē´ priests, with the candidate in advance (No.&nbsp;30),
approach and enter the Midē´wigân and the initiation begins. No. 31 is
the place of the sacred drum and those who are detailed to employ the
drum and rattles, while No. 32 indicates the officiating priests; No. 33
is the degree post, surmounted by Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´, the Owl (No.&nbsp;34).
The post is painted with vermilion, with small white spots all over its
surface, emblematic of the mī´gis shell. The line (No.&nbsp;35)
extending along the upper portion of the inclosure represents the pole
from which are suspended the robes, blankets, kettles, etc., which
constitute the fee paid to the society for admission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This degree is presided over and guarded by the Panther
Man´idō.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the candidate has been able to procure enough gifts to
present to the society for the second degree, he takes his drum and
offers chants (No.&nbsp;35) to Ki´tshi Man´idō for success. Ki´tshi
Man´idō himself is the guardian of the second degree and his footprints
are shown in No. 36. No. 37 represents the second degree inclosure, and
contains two sacred posts (Nos. 38 and&nbsp;39), the first of which is
the same as that of the first degree, the second being painted with
white clay, bearing two bands of vermilion, one about the top and one
near the middle. A small branch near the top is used, after the ceremony
is over, to hang the tobacco pouch on. No. 40 represents the musicians
and attendants; No. 41 the candidate upon his knees; while Nos. 42, 43,
44, and 45 pictures the officiating priests who surround him. The
horizontal pole (No.&nbsp;46) has presents of robes, blankets, and
kettles suspended from&nbsp;it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When a candidate is prepared to advance to the third degree
(No.&nbsp;47) he personates Makwa´ Man´idō, who is the guardian of this
degree, and whose tracks (No.&nbsp;48) are visible. The assistants are
visible upon the interior, drumming and dancing. There are three sacred
posts, the first (No.&nbsp;49) is black, and upon this is placed
Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´&mdash;the Owl; the second (No.&nbsp;50) is painted with
white clay and has upon the top the effigy of an owl; while the third
(No.&nbsp;51) is painted with vermilion, bearing upon the summit the
effigy of an Indian. Small wooden effigies of the human figure are used
by the Midē´ in their tests of the proof of the genuineness and
sacredness of their religion, which tests will be alluded to under
another caption. The horizontal rod (No.&nbsp;52), extending from one
end of the structure to the other, has suspended from it the blankets
and other gifts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The guardian of the fourth degree is Maka´no&mdash;the
Turtle&mdash;as he appears (No.&nbsp;53) facing the entrance of the
fourth degree (No.&nbsp;54). Four sacred posts are planted in the fourth
degree; the first (No.&nbsp;55), being painted white upon the upper half
and green upon the lower; the second (No.&nbsp;56) similar; the third
(No.&nbsp;57) painted red, with a black spiral line extending from the
top to the bottom, and upon which is placed Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´&mdash;the Owl;
and the fourth (No.&nbsp;58), a cross, the arms and part of the trunk of
which is white, with red spots&mdash;to designate the sacred
mī´gis&mdash;the lower half of the trunk cut square, the face toward the
east painted red, the south green, the west white, and the north black.
The spot (No.&nbsp;59) at the base of the cross signifies the place of
the sacred stone, while the human figures (No.&nbsp;60) designate the
participants, some of whom are seated near the wall of the inclosure,
whilst others are represented as beating the drum. Upon the horizontal
pole (No.&nbsp;61) are shown the blankets constituting gifts to the
society.</blockquote>

Plate VII. Ojibwa Facial Decoration.</p>

<p>The several specific methods of facial decoration employed (<a href =
"#plateVII">Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">VII</span></a>),
according to Ojibwa’s statement, are as follows:</p>

<p><i>First degree.</i>&mdash;One stripe of vermilion across the face,
from near the ears across the tip of the nose.</p>

<p><i>Second degree.</i>&mdash;One stripe as above, and another across
the eyelids, temples, and the root of the nose.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
<!--png 243-->
<i>Third degree.</i>&mdash;The upper half of the face is painted green
and the lower half red.</p>

<p><i>Fourth degree.</i>&mdash;The forehead and left side of the face,
from the outer canthus of the eye downward, is painted green; four spots
of vermilion are made with the tip of the finger upon the forehead and
four upon the green surface of the left cheek. In addition to this, the
plumes of the golden eagle, painted red, are worn upon the head and down
the back. This form of decoration is not absolutely necessary, as the
expense of the “war bonnet” places it beyond the reach of the greater
number of persons.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further with the explanation of the
<ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original: word is usually written ‘Midē´’">Mide´</ins> records it
may be of interest to quote the traditions relative to the migration of
the Ani´shinâ´bēg, as obtained by Mr. Warren previous to 1853. In his
reference to observing the rites of initiation he heard one of the
officiating priests deliver “a loud and spirited harangue,” of which the
following words<a class = "tag" href = "#note12" name = "tag12" id =
"tag12">12</a> caught his attention:</p>

<blockquote><ins class = "correction" title =
"open quote missing">“</ins>Our forefathers
were living on the great salt water
toward the rising sun, the great Megis (seashell) showed itself above
the surface of the great water and the rays of the sun for a long time
period were reflected from its glossy back. It gave warmth and light to
the An-ish-in-aub-ag (red race). All at once it sank into the deep, and
for a time our ancestors were not blessed with its light. It rose to the
surface and appeared again on the great river which drains the waters of
the Great Lakes, and again for a long time it gave life to our
forefathers and reflected back the rays of the sun. Again it disappeared
from sight and it rose not till it appeared to the eyes of the
An-ish-in-aub-ag on the shores of the first great lake. Again it sank
from sight, and death daily visited the wigiwams of our forefathers till
it showed its back and reflected the rays of the sun once more at
Bow-e-ting (Sault Ste. Marie). Here it remained for a long time, but
once more, and for the last time, it disappeared, and the
An-ish-in-aub-ag was left in darkness and misery, till it floated and
once more showed its bright back at Mo-ning-wun-a-kaun-ing (La Pointe
Island), where it has ever since reflected back the rays of the sun and
blessed our ancestors with life, light, and wisdom. Its rays reach the
remotest village of the widespread Ojibways.” As the old man delivered
this talk he continued to display the shell, which he represented as an
emblem of the great megis of which he was speaking.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A few days after, anxious to learn the true meaning of this
allegory,<span class = "pad1"> ***</span>I requested him to explain to
me the meaning of his Me-da-we harangue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After filling his pipe and smoking of the tobacco I had
presented he proceeded to give me the desired information, as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“My grandson,” said he, “the megis I spoke of means the
Me-da-we religion. Our forefathers, many string of lives ago, lived on
the shores of the great salt water in the east. Here, while they were
suffering the ravages of sickness and death, the Great Spirit, at the
intercession of Man-a-bo-sho, the great common uncle of the
An-ish-in-aub-ag, granted them this rite, wherewith life is restored and
prolonged. Our forefathers moved from the shores of the great water and
proceeded westward.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Me-da-we lodge was pulled down, and it was not again
erected till our forefathers again took a stand on the shores of the
great river where Mo-ne-aung (Montreal) now stands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the course of time this town was again deserted, and our
forefathers, still
<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
<a name = "page184" id = "page184"> </a>
<!--png 244-->
proceeding westward, lit not their fires till they reached the shores of
Lake Huron, where again the rites of the Me-da-we were
practiced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Again these rites were forgotten, and the Me-da-we lodge
was not built till the Ojibways found themselves congregated at
Bow-e-ting (outlet of Lake Superior), where it remained for many
winters. Still the Ojibways moved westward, and for the last time the
Me-da-we lodge was erected on the island of La Pointe, and here, long
before the pale face appeared among them, it was practiced in its purest
and most original form. Many of our fathers lived the full term of life
granted to mankind by the Great Spirit, and the forms of many old people
were mingled with each rising generation. This, my grandson, is the
meaning of the words you did not understand; they have been repeated to
us by our fathers for many generations.”</blockquote>

<p>In the explanation of the chart obtained at Red Lake, together with
the tradition, reference to the otter, as being the most sacred emblem
of society, is also verified in a brief notice of a tradition by Mr.
Warren,<a class = "tag" href = "#note13" name = "tag13" id =
"tag13">13</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>There is another tradition told by the old men of the
Ojibway village of Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, which tells of their
former residence on the shores of the great salt water. It is, however,
so similar in character to the one I have related that its introduction
here would only occupy unnecessary space. The only difference between
the two traditions is that the otter, which is emblematical of one of
the four Medicine Spirits who are believed to preside over the Midawe
rites, is used in one in the same figurative manner as the seashell is
used in the other, first appearing to the ancient An-ish-in-aub-ag from
the depths of the great salt water, again on the river St. Lawrence,
then on Lake Huron at Sault Ste. Marie, again at La Pointe, but lastly
at Fond du Lac, or end of Lake Superior, where it is said to have forced
the sand bank at the mouth of the St. Louis River. The place is still
pointed out by the Indians where they believe the great otter broke
through.</blockquote>

<p>It is affirmed by the Indians that at Sault Ste. Marie some of the
Ojibwa separated from the main body of that tribe and traversed the
country along the northern shore of Lake Superior toward the west. These
have since been known of as the “Bois Forts” (hardwood people or timber
people), other bands being located at Pigeon River, Rainy Lake, etc.
Another separation occurred at La Pointe, one party going toward Fond du
Lac and westward to Red Lake, where they claim to have resided for more
than three hundred years, while the remainder scattered from La Pointe
westward and southwestward, locating at favorable places throughout the
timbered country. This early dismemberment and long-continued separation
of the Ojibwa nation accounts, to a considerable extent, for the several
versions of the migration and the sacred emblems connected with the
Midē´wiwin, the northern bands generally maintaining their faith in
favor of the Otter as the guide, while the southern bodies are almost
entirely supporters of the belief in the great mī´gis.</p>

<p>On account of the independent operations of the Midē´ priests in the
various settlements of the Ojibwa, and especially because of the slight
intercourse between those of the northern and southern divisions of the
nation, there has arisen a difference in the pictographic
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
<a name = "page185" id = "page185"> </a>
<!--png 245-->
representation of the same general ideas, variants which are frequently
not recognized by Midē´ priests who are not members of the Midē´wiwin in
which these mnemonic charts had their origin. As there are variants in
the pictographic delineation of originally similar ideas, there are also
corresponding variations in the traditions pertaining to them.</p>

</p>
<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Birch-bark record, from
White Earth.</p>

<p>The tradition relating to Mi´nabō´zho and the sacred objects received
from Ki´tshi Man´idō for the Ani´shinâ´bēg is illustrated in <a href =
"#fig6">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>, which is a reproduction of a chart preserved at
White Earth. The record is read from left to right. No. 1 represents
Mi´nabō´zho, who says of the adjoining characters representing the
members of the Midē´wiwin: “They are the ones, they are the ones, who
put into my heart the life.” Mi´nabō´zho holds in his left hand the
sacred Midē´ sack, or pin-ji´-gu-sân´. Nos. 2 and 3 represent the
drummers. At the sound of the drum all the Midē´ rise and become
inspired, because Ki´tshi Man´idō is then present in the wig´iwam. No. 4
denotes that women also have the privilege of becoming members of the
Midē´wiwin. The figure holds in the left hand the Midē´ sack, made of a
snake skin. No. 5 represents the Tortoise, the guardian spirit who was
the giver of some of the sacred objects used in the rite. No. 6, the
Bear, also a benevolent Man´idō, but not held in so great veneration as
the Tortoise. His tracks are visible in the Midē´wiwin. No. 7, the
sacred Midē´ sack or pin-ji´-gu-sân´, which contains life, and can be
used by the Midē´ to prolong the life of a sick person. No. 8 represents
a Dog, given by the Midē´ Man´idōs to Mi´nabō´zho as a companion.</p>

<p>Such was the interpretation given by the owner of the chart, but the
informant was unconsciously in error, as has been ascertained not only
from other Midē´ priests consulted with regard to the true meaning, but
also in the light of later information and research in the
exemplification of the ritual of the Midē´wiwin.</p>

<p>Mi´nabō´zho did not receive the rite from any Midē´ priests (Nos. 2
and&nbsp;5), but from Ki´tshi Man´idō. Women are not mentioned in any of
the earlier traditions of the origin of the society, neither was the dog
given to Mi´nabō´zho, but Mi´nabō´zho gave it to the Ani´shinâ´bēg.</p>

<p>The chart, therefore, turns out to be a mnemonic song similar to
others to be noted hereafter, and the owner probably copied it from
<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<a name = "page186" id = "page186"> </a>

a chart in the possession of a stranger Midē´, and failed to learn its
true signification, simply desiring it to add to his collection of
sacred objects and to gain additional respect from his confrères and
admirers.</p>

almost identical, one appearing to be a copy of the other. These are

having originally received the Midē´wiwin from Ki´tshi Man´idō, but it
is believed that the word is a synonym or a substitute based upon some
reason to them inexplicable. These figures were obtained in 1887, and a
brief explanation of them given in the American Anthropologist.<a class

I could obtain but little direct information from the owners of the
records, but it has since been ascertained that both are mnemonic songs
pertaining to Mi´nabō´zho, or rather Eshgibō´ga, and do not form a part
of the sacred records of the Midē´wiwin, but simply the pictographic
representation of the possibilities and powers of the alleged religion.
The following explanation of Figs. <a href = "#fig7">7</a> and <a href =

MIDĒ´WIGÂN.</a></h5>

<p>Initiation into the Midē´wiwin or Midē´ Society is, at this time,
performed during the latter part of summer. The ceremonies are performed
in public, as the structure in which they are conducted is often loosely
constructed of poles with intertwined branches and leaves, leaving the
top almost entirely exposed, so that there is no difficulty in observing
what may transpire within. Furthermore, the ritual is unintelligible to
the uninitiated, and the important part of the necessary information is
given to the candidate in a preceptor’s wig´iwam.</p>

<p>To present intelligibly a description of the ceremonial of initiation
as it occurred at White Earth, Minnesota, it will be necessary to first
describe the structure in which it occurs, as well as the sweat lodge
with which the candidate has also to&nbsp;do.</p>

<p>The Midē´wigân, i.e., Midē´wig´iwam, or, as it is generally
designated “Grand Medicine Lodge,” is usually built in an open grove or
clearing; it is a structure measuring about 80 feet in length by 20 in
width, extending east and west with the main entrance toward that point
of the compass at which the sun rises. The walls consist of poles and
saplings from 8 to 10 feet high, firmly planted in the ground, wattled
with short branches and twigs with leaves. In the east and west walls
are left open spaces, each about 4 feet wide,
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
<a name = "page188" id = "page188"> </a>
<!--png 248-->
used as entrances to the inclosure. From each side of the opening the
wall-like structure extends at right angles to the end wall, appearing
like a short hallway leading to the inclosure, and resembles double
doors opened outward. <a href = "#fig10">Fig. 10</a> represents a ground
plan of the Midē´wigân, while <a href = "#fig11">Fig. 11</a> shows an
interior view. Saplings thrown across the top of the structure serve as
rafters, upon which are laid branches with leaves, and pieces of bark,
to sufficiently shade the occupants from the rays of the sun. Several
saplings extend across the inclosure near the top, while a few are
attached to these so as to extend longitudinally, from either side of
which presents of blankets, etc., may be suspended. About 10 feet from
the main entrance a large flattened stone, measuring more than a foot in
diameter, is placed upon the ground. This is used when subjecting to
treatment a patient; and at a corresponding distance from the western
door is planted the sacred Midē´ post of cedar, that for the first
degree being about 7 feet in height and 6 or 8 inches in diameter. It is
painted red, with a band of green 4 inches wide around the top. Upon the
post is fixed the stuffed body of an owl. Upon that part of the floor
midway between the stone and the Midē´ post is spread a blanket, upon
which the gifts and presents to the society are afterward deposited. A
short distance from each of the outer angles of the structure are
planted cedar or pine trees, each about 10 feet in height.</p>

About a hundred yards east of the main entrance is constructed a
wig´iwam or sweat lodge, to be used by the candidate, both to take his
vapor baths and to receive final instructions from his preceptor.</p>

<p>This wig´iwam is dome-shaped<ins class = "correction"
title = "so in original: ‘and measures’, ‘measuring’?"> measures</ins>
about 10 feet in
diameter and 6 feet high in the middle, with an opening at the top which
can be readily covered with a piece of bark. The framework of the
structure consists of saplings stuck into the ground, the tops being
bent over to meet others from the opposite side. Other thin saplings are
then lashed horizontally to the upright ones so as to appear like hoops,
decreasing in size as the summit is reached. They are secured by using
strands of basswood bark. The whole is then covered with pieces of
birchbark&mdash;frequently the bark of the pine is used&mdash;leaving a
narrow opening on the side facing the Midē´wigân, which may be closed
with an adjustable flap of bark or blankets.</p>

<p>The space between the Midē´wigân and the sweat lodge must be kept
clear of other temporary shelters, which might be placed there by some
of the numerous visitors attending the ceremonies.</p>

PREPARATORY INSTRUCTION.</a></h5>

<p>When the candidate’s application for reception into the Midē´wiwin
has been received by one of the officiating priests, he calls upon the
three assisting Midē´, inviting them to visit him at his own wig´iwam at
a specified time. When the conference takes place, tobacco, which has
been previously furnished by the candidate, is distributed and a smoke
offering made to Ki´tshi Man´idō, to propitiate his favor in the
deliberations about to be undertaken. The host then explains the object
of the meeting, and presents to his auditors an account of the
candidate’s previous life; he recounts the circumstances of his fast and
dreams, and if the candidate is to take the place of a lately deceased
son who had been prepared to receive the degree, the fact is mentioned,
as under such circumstances the forms would be different from the
ordinary method of reception into the society. The subject of presents
and gifts to the individual members of the society, as well as those
intended to be given as a fee to the officiating priests, is also
discussed; and lastly, if all things are favorable to the applicant, the
selection of an instructor or preceptor is made, this person being
usually appointed from among these four priests.</p>

<p>When the conference is ended the favorable decision is announced to
the applicant, who acknowledges his pleasure by remitting to each of the
four priests gifts of tobacco. He is told what instructor would be most
acceptable to them, when he repairs to the wig´iwam of the person
designated and informs him of his wish and the decision of the Midē´
council.</p>

<p>The designated preceptor arranges with his pupil to have certain days
upon which the latter is to call and receive instruction and acquire
<span class = "pagenum">190</span>
<a name = "page190" id = "page190"> </a>
<!--png 250-->
information. The question of remuneration being settled, tobacco is
furnished at each sitting, as the Midē´ never begins his lecture until
after having made a smoke-offering, which is done by taking a whiff and
pointing the stem to the east; then a whiff, directing the stem to the
south; another whiff, directing the stem to the west; then a whiff and a
similar gesture with the stem to the north; another whiff is taken
slowly and with an expression of reverence, when the stem is pointed
forward and upward as an offering to Ki´tshi Man´idō; and finally, after
taking a similar whiff, the stem is pointed forward and downward toward
the earth as an offering to Nokō´mis, the grandmother of the universe,
and to those who have passed before. After these preliminaries, the
candidate receives at each meeting only a small amount of information,
because the longer the instruction is continued daring the season before
the meeting at which it is hoped the candidate may be admitted the
greater will be the fees; and also, in order that the instruction may be
looked upon with awe and reverence, most of the information imparted is
frequently a mere repetition, the ideas being clothed in ambiguous
phraseology. The Midē´ drum (<a href = "#fig12">Fig.
12&nbsp;<i>a</i></a>) differs from the drum commonly used in dances (<a
href = "#fig12">Fig. 12&nbsp;<i>b</i></a>) in the fact that it is
cylindrical, consisting of an elongated kettle or wooden vessel, or
perhaps a section of the hollow trunk of a tree about 10 inches in
diameter and from 18 to 20 inches in length, over both ends of which
rawhide is stretched while wet, so that upon drying the membrane becomes
hard and tense, producing, when beaten, a very hard, loud tone, which
may be heard at a great distance.</p>

<p>Frequently, however, water is put into the bottom of the drum and the
drum-head stretched across the top in a wet state, which appears to
intensify the sound very considerably.</p>

<p>The peculiar and special properties of the drum are described to the
applicant; that it was at first the gift of Ki´tshi Man´idō, who gave it
through the intercession of Mi´nabō´zho; that it is used to invoke the
presence of the Midē´ Man´idōs, or sacred spirits, when seeking

direction as to information desired, success, etc.; that it is to be
employed at the side of the sick to assist in the expulsion or exorcism
of evil man´idōs who may possess the body of the sufferer; and that it
is to be used in the. Midē´wigân during the initiation of new members or
the advancement of a Midē´ from a degree to a higher one.</p>

<p>The properties of the rattle are next enumerated and recounted, its
origin is related, and its uses explained. It is used at the side of a
patient and has even more power in the expulsion of evil demons than the
drum. The rattle is also employed in some of the sacred songs as an
accompaniment, to accentuate certain notes and words. There are two
forms used, one consisting of a cylindrical tin box filled with grains
of corn or other seeds (<a href = "#fig13">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>), the other
being a hollow gourd also filled with seed (<a href =
"#fig14">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>). In both of these the handle passes entirely
through the rattle case.</p>

<p>In a similar manner the remaining gifts of Mi´nabō´zho are instanced
and their properties extolled.</p>

<p>The mī´gis, a small white shell (Cypræa moneta&nbsp;L.) is next
extracted from the Midē´ sack, or pinji´gusân´. This is explained as
being the sacred emblem of the Midē´wiwin, the reason therefor being
given in the account of the several traditions presented in connection
with Pls. <span class = "smallroman">III</span>, <span class =
"smallroman">IV</span>, and <span class = "smallroman">VIII</span>. This
information is submitted in parts, so that the narrative of the history
connected with either of the records is extended over a period of time
to suit the preceptor’s plans and purposes. The ceremony of shooting the
mī´gis (see <a href = "#fig15">Fig.&nbsp;15</a>) is explained on page

<p>As time progresses the preceptor instructs his pupil in Midē´ songs,
i.e., he sings to him songs which form a part of his stock in trade, and
which are alleged to be of service on special occasions, as when
searching for medicinal plants, hunting, etc. The pupil thus acquires a
comprehension of the method of preparing and reciting songs, which
information is by him subsequently put to practical use in the
composition and preparation of his own songs, the mnemonic characters
employed being often rude copies of those observed upon the charts of
his preceptor, but the arrangement thereof being original.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that a Midē´ is seldom, if ever, able to recite
correctly any songs but his own, although he may be fully aware of the
character of the record and the particular class of service in which it
may be employed. In support of this assertion several songs obtained at
Red Lake and imperfectly explained by “Little Frenchman” and “Leading
Feather,” are reproduced in <a href = "#plateXXIIa">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XXII</span>,&nbsp;A</a> <a href = "#plateXXIIb">B</a>, page

<!--png 252-->
From among the various songs given by my preceptor are selected and
presented herewith those recognized by him as being part of the ritual.
The greater number of songs are mere repetitions of short phrases, and
frequently but single words, to which are added meaningless sounds or
syllables to aid in prolonging the musical tones, and repeated ad
libitum in direct proportion to the degree of inspiration in which the
singer imagines himself to have attained. These frequent outbursts of
singing are not based upon connected mnemonic songs preserved upon birch
bark, but they consist of fragments or selections of songs which have
been memorized, the selections relating to the subject upon which the
preceptor has been discoursing, and which undoubtedly prompts a rythmic
vocal equivalent. These songs are reproduced on Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">IX</span>, <a href = "#plateIXa">A,</a> <a href =
"#plateIXb">B,</a>&nbsp;<a href = "#plateIXc">C</a>. The initial
mnemonic characters pertaining to each word or phrase of the original
text are repeated below in regular order with translations in English,
together with supplemental notes explanatory of the characters employed.
The musical notation is not presented, as the singing consists of a
monotonous repetition of four or five notes in a minor key; furthermore,
a sufficiently clear idea of this may be formed by comparing some of the
Midē´ songs presented in connection with the ritual of initiation and
preparation of medicines. The first of the songs given herewith (<a href
= "#plateIXa">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">IX</span>,&nbsp;A</a>)
pertains to a request to Ki´tshi Man´idō that clear weather may be had
for the
<span class = "pagenum">193</span>

<!--png 255-->
day of ceremonial, and also an affirmation to the candidate that the
singer’s words are a faithful rendering of his creed.</p>

<p>Each of the phrases is repeated before advancing to the next, as
often as the singer desires and in proportion to the amount of reverence
and awe with which he wishes to impress his hearer. There is usually a
brief interval between each of the phrases, and a longer one at the
appearance of a vertical line, denoting a rest, or pause. One song may
occupy, therefore, from fifteen minutes to half an hour.</p>

MIDĒ´ THERAPEUTICS.</a></h5>

<p>During the period of time in which the candidate is instructed in the
foregoing traditions, myths, and songs the subject of Midē´ plants is
also discussed. The information pertaining to the identification and
preparation of the various vegetable substances is not imparted in
regular order, only one plant or preparation, or perhaps two, being
enlarged upon at a specified consultation. It may be that the candidate
is taken into the woods where it is known that a specified plant or tree
may be found, when a smoke offering is made before the object is pulled
out of the soil, and a small pinch of tobacco put into the hole in the
ground from which it was taken. This is an offering to
Noko´mis&mdash;the earth, the grandmother of mankind&mdash;for the
benefits which are derived from her body where they were placed by
Ki´tshi Man´idō.</p>

<p>In the following list are presented, as far as practicable, the
botanical and common names of these, there being a few instances in
which the plants were not to be had, as they were foreign to that
portion of Minnesota in which the investigations were made; a few of
them, also, were not identified by the preceptors, as they were out of
season.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in this list the number of infusions and
decoctions which are, from a medical and scientific standpoint, specific
remedies for the complaints for which they are recommended. It is
probable that the long continued intercourse between the Ojibwa and the
Catholic Fathers, who were tolerably well versed in the ruder forms of
medication, had much to do with improving an older and purely aboriginal
form of practicing medical magic. In some of the remedies mentioned
below there may appear to be philosophic reasons for their
administration, but upon closer investigation it has been learned that
the cure is not attributed to a regulation or restoration of functional
derangement, but to the removal or even expulsion of malevolent
beings&mdash;commonly designated as bad Man´idōs&mdash;supposed to have
taken possession of that part of the body in which such derangement
appears most conspicuous. Further reference to the mythic properties of
some of the plants employed will be made at the proper time.</p>

<p>Although the word Mashki kiwa´bu<sup>n</sup>&mdash;medicine
broth&mdash;signifies liquid medical preparations, the term is usually
employed in a general sense to pertain to the entire materia medica; and
in addition to the alleged medicinal virtues extolled by the preceptors,
certain parts of the trees and plants enumerated are eaten on account of
some mythic reason, or employed in the construction or manufacture of
habitations, utensils, and weapons, because of some supposed
supernatural origin or property, an explanation of which they have
forgotten.</p>

<p>It is affirmed by various members of the Midē´ Society that in former
times much of the information relating to some of these plants was not
imparted to a candidate for initiation into the first degree, but was
reserved for succeeding degrees, to induce a Midē´ of the first degree
to endeavor to attain higher distinction and further advancement in the
mysteries of the order. As much knowledge
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
<a name = "page202" id = "page202"> </a>
<!--png 264-->
is believed to have been lost through the reticence and obstinacy of
former chief priests, the so-called higher secrets are now imparted at
the first and second degree preparatory instructions. The third and
fourth degrees are very rarely conferred, chiefly because the necessary
presents and fees are beyond the reach of those who so desire
advancement, and partly also because the missionaries, and in many
instances the Indian agents, have done their utmost to suppress the
ceremonies, because they were a direct opposition and hindrance to
progress in Christianizing influences.</p>

<p>When the preparatory instruction has come to an end and the day of
the ceremony of initiation is at hand, the preceptor sings to his pupil
a song, expatiating upon his own efforts and the high virtue of the
knowledge imparted. The pipe is brought forward and an offering of
tobacco smoke made by both preceptor and pupil, after which the former
sings a song (<a href = "#plateXa">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">X</span>,&nbsp;A</a>.), the time of its utterance being
tediously prolonged. The mnemonic characters were drawn by Sikas´sigĕ,
and are a copy of an old birch-bark scroll which has for many years been
in his possession, and which was made in imitation of one in the
possession of his father, Baiē´dzĭk, one of the leading Midē´ at Mille
Lacs, Minnesota.</p>

<p>From ten days to two weeks before the day of initiation, the chief
Midē´ priest sends out to all the members invitations, which consist of
sticks one-fourth of an inch thick and 6 or 7 inches long. The courier
is charged with giving to the person invited explicit information as to
the day of the ceremony and the locality where it is to
<span class = "pagenum">204</span>
<a name = "page204" id = "page204"> </a>
<!--png 268-->
be held. Sometimes these sticks have bands of color painted around one
end, usually green, sometimes red, though both colors may be employed,
the two ends being thus tinted. The person invited is obliged to bring
with him his invitation stick, and upon entering the Midē´wigân he lays
it upon the ground near the sacred stone, on the side toward the degree
post. In case a Midē´ is unable to attend he sends his invitation with a
statement of the reason of his inability to come. The number of sticks
upon the floor are counted, on the morning of the day of initiation, and
the number of those present to attend the ceremonies is known before the
initiation begins.</p>

<p>About five or six days preceding the day set for the ceremony of
initiation, the candidate removes to the neighborhood of the locality of
the Midē´wigân. On the evening of the fifth day he repairs to the
sudatory or sweat-lodge, which has, in the meantime, been built east of
the sacred inclosure, and when seated within he is supplied with water
which he keeps for making vapor by pouring it upon heated stones
introduced for the purpose by assistants upon the outside. This act of
purification is absolutely necessary and must be performed once each day
for four days, though the process may be shortened by taking two vapor
baths in one day, thus limiting the process to two days. This, however,
is permitted, or desired only under extraordinary circumstances. During
the process of purgation, the candidates thoughts must dwell upon the
seriousness of the course he is pursuing and the sacred character of the
new life he is about to assume.</p>

<p>When the fumigation has ceased he is visited by the preceptor and the
other officiating Midē´ priests, when the conversation is confined
chiefly to the candidate’s progress. He then gives to each of them
presents of tobacco, and after an offering to Ki´tshi Man´idō, with the
pipe, they expose the articles contained in their Midē´ sacks and
explain and expatiate upon the merits and properties of each of the
magic objects. The candidate for the first time learns of the manner of
preparing effigies, etc., with which to present to the incredulous
ocular demonstration of the genuineness and divine origin of the
Midē´wiwin, or, as it is in this connection termed, religion.</p>

<p>Several methods are employed for the purpose, and the greater the
power of the Midē´ the greater will appear the mystery connected with
the exhibition. This may be performed whenever circumstances demand such
proof, but the tests are made before the candidate with a twofold
purpose: first, to impress him with the supernatural powers of the Midē´
themselves; and second, in an oracular manner, to ascertain if Ki´tshi
Ma´nidō is pleased with the contemplated ceremony and the initiation of
the candidate.</p>

<p>The first test is made by laying upon the floor of the wig´iwam a
string of four wooden beads each measuring about 1 inch in diameter. See
<a href = "#fig16">Fig.&nbsp;16</a>. After the owner of this object has
chanted for a few moments in an almost inaudible manner the beads begin
to roll from side to side as if animated. The string is then quickly
restored to its place in the Midē´ sack. Another Midē´ produces a small
wooden effigy of a man (<a href = "#fig17">Fig.&nbsp;17</a>), measuring
about 5 inches in height. The body has a small orifice running through
it from between the shoulders to the buttocks, the head and neck forming
a separate piece which may be attached to the body like a glass stopper
to a bottle.</p>

<p>A hole is made in the ground deep enough to reach to the hips of the
effigy, when the latter is put into it and the loose earth loosely
restored so as to hold it in an upright position. Some magic powder of
herbs is sprinkled around the body, and into the vertical orifice in
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>

<!--png 270-->
it, when the head is put in place. A series of inarticulate utterances
are chanted, when, if everything be favorable, the figure will
perceptibly move up and down as if possessed of life. <a href =
"#fig18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a> represents another figure used in a similar
manner. It consists of one piece, however, and is decorated with narrow
bands of dark blue flannel about the ankles and knees, a patch of red
cloth upon the breast and bands about the wrists, each of the eyes being
indicated by three white porcelain beads.</p>

<p>One of the most astonishing tests, however, and one that can be
produced only by Midē´ of the highest power, consists in causing a Midē´
sack to move upon the ground as if it were alive. This, it is
confidently alleged, has been done repeatedly, though it is evident that
the deception is more easily produced than in the above-mentioned
instances, as the temporary retention within a bag of a small mammal
could readily be made to account for the movements.</p>

<p>In most of these private exhibitions the light is so obscured as to
prevent the deception being observed and exposed; and when public
demonstrations of skill are made the auditors invariably consist of the
most credulous of the uninitiated, or the confréres of the performer,
from whom no antagonism or doubt would be expected.</p>

<p>The preceptor then consults with the Midē´ priests respecting the
presents to be delivered by the candidate, and repeats the following
words, viz:</p>

<p>When the four vapor baths have been taken by the candidate, and the
eve of the ceremony has arrived, he remains in the sudatory longer than
usual so as not to come in contact with the large crowd of visitors who
have arrived upon the scene. The woods resound with the noises incident
to a large camp, while in various directions may be heard the monotonous
beating of the drum indicating the presence of a number of dancers, or
the hard, sharp taps of the midē´ drum, caused by a priest propitiating
and invoking the presence and favor of Ki´tshi Ma´nidō in the service
now so near at hand.</p>

<p>When the night is far advanced and all becomes hushed, the candidate,
with only the preceptor accompanying, retires to his own wig´iwam, while
the assistant Midē´ priests and intimate friends or members of his
family collect the numerous presents and suspend them from the
transverse and longitudinal poles in the upper part of the Midē´wigân.
Watchers remain to see that nothing is removed during the night.</p>

<p>At the approach of day, the candidate breakfasts and again returns to
the sweat-lodge to await the coming of his preceptor, and, later, of the
officiating priests. The candidate puts on his best clothing
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<a name = "page207" id = "page207"> </a>
<!--png 271-->
and such articles of beaded ornaments as he may possess. The preceptor
and Midē´ priests are also clad in their finest apparel, each wearing
one or two beaded dancing bags at his side, secured by a band of beaded
cloth crossing the opposite shoulder. The members of the Midē´wiwin who
are not directly concerned in the preliminaries resort to the Midē´wigân
and take seats around the interior, near the wall, where they may
continue to smoke, or may occasionally drum and sing. The drummer, with
his assistants, takes a place near upon the floor of the sacred
inclosure to the left of the eastern entrance, i.e., the southeast
corner.</p>

dispel the clouds. Each of the lines is repeated an indefinite number of
times, and after being repeated once or twice is sung also by the others
as an accompaniment.</p>

chanted or sung.</p>

<p>In case the appearance of the sky becomes sufficiently favorable the
initiation begins, but if it should continue to be more unfavorable or
to rain, then the song termed the “Rain Song” is resorted to and sung
within the inclosure of the Midē´wigân, to which they all march in
solemn procession. Those Midē´ priests who have with them their Midē´
drums use them as an accompaniment to the singing and to propitiate the
good will of Ki´tshi Man´idō. Each line of the entire song appears as an
independent song, the intervals of rest varying in time according to the
feelings of the officiating priest.</p>

<p>The words of the song are known to most of the Midē´ priests; but, as
there is no method of retaining a set form of musicial notation, the
result is entirely individual and may vary with each singer, if sung
independently and out of hearing of others; so that, under
<span class = "pagenum">210</span>

ordinary circumstances, the priest who leads off sings through one
stanza of the song, after which the others will readily catch the notes
and accompany him. It will be observed, also, that the words as spoken
vary to some extent when chanted or sung.</p>

<p>If this song does not appear to bring about a favorable change the
priests return to their respective wig´iwams and the crowd of visitors
disperses to return upon the first clear day.</p>

the officiating priest. After all preliminaries have been arranged and
the proper time for regular proceedings has arrived, the preceptor sings
the following song (<a href = "#plateXc">Pl. <span class =

<p>The Midē´ priests then leave the sweat-lodge and stand upon the
outside, while the candidate gathers up in his arms a number of small
presents, such as tobacco, handkerchiefs, etc., and goes out of the
wig´iwam to join the Midē´ priests. The order of marching to the main
entrance of the Midē´wigân is then taken up in the following order:
First the candidate, next the preceptor, who in turn is followed by the
officiating priests, and such others, and members of his family and
relatives as desire. At the door of the Midē´wigân all but one of the
priests continue forward and take their stations within the inclosure,
the preceptor remaining on one side of the candidate, the Midē´ priest
upon the other, then all march four times around the outside of the
inclosure, toward the left or south, during which time drumming is
continued within. Upon the completion of the fourth circuit the
candidate is placed so as to face the main entrance of the Midē´wigân.

<p>The presents are then laid upon the ground. The preceptor goes
inside, taking with him the gifts deposited by the candidate, and
remains standing just within the door and faces the degree post toward
the west. Then the chief officiating priest, who has remained at the
side of the candidate, turns toward the latter and in a clear, distinct,
and exceedingly impressive manner sings the following chant, addressed
to Ki´tshi Man´idō whose invisible form is supposed to abide within the
Midē´wigan during such ceremonies, stating that the candidate is
presented to receive life (the mī´gis) for which he is suffering, and
invoking the divine favor.</p>

along the western side to the point of beginning. This is done four
times. As he starts upon his march, the member nearest the door falls in
the line of procession, each member continuing to drop in, at the rear,
until the entire assembly is in motion. During this movement there is a
monotonous drumming upon the Midē´ drums and the chief officiating
priest sings:</p>

occupied by them, the candidate going and remaining with his preceptor
to a point just inside the eastern entrance, while the four officiating
priests continue around toward the opposite end of the inclosure and
station themselves in a semicircle just beyond the degree post, and
facing the western door. Upon the ground before them are spread blankets
and similar goods, which have been removed from the beams above, and
upon which the candidate is to kneel. He is then led to the western
extremity of the inclosure where he

stands upon the blankets spread upon the ground and faces the four Midē´
priests. The preceptor takes his position behind and a little to one
side of the candidate, another assistant being called upon by the
preceptor to occupy a corresponding position upon the other side. During
this procedure there is gentle drumming which ceases after all have been
properly stationed, when the preceptor steps to a point to the side and
front of the candidate and nearer the officiating priests, and says:</p>

After this song is ended the drum is handed to one of the members
sitting near by, when the fourth and last of the officiating priests
says to the candidate, who is now placed upon his knees:</p>

<p>This priest then grasps his Midē´ sack as if holding a gun, and,
clutching it near the top with the left hand extended, while with the
right he clutches it below the middle or near the base, he aims it
toward the candidate’s left breast and makes a thrust forward toward
that target uttering the syllables “yâ, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,”
rapidly, rising to a higher key. He recovers his first position and
repeats this movement three times, becoming more and more animated, the
last time making a vigorous gesture toward the kneeling man’s breast as
if shooting him. (See <a href = "#fig15">Fig. 15</a>, page 192.) While
this is going on, the preceptor and his assistants place their hands
upon the candidate’s shoulders and cause his body to tremble.</p>

<p>Then the next Midē´, the third of the quartette, goes through a
similar series of forward movements and thrusts with his Midē´ sack,
uttering similar sounds and shooting the sacred
mī´gis&mdash;life&mdash;into the right breast of the candidate, who is
agitated still more strongly than before. When the third Midē´, the
second in order of precedence, goes through similar gestures and
pretends to shoot the mī´gis into the candidate’s heart, the preceptors
assist him to be violently agitated.</p>

<p>The leading priest now places himself in a threatening attitude and
says to the Midē´; “Mī´-dzhi-de´-a-mi-shĭk´”&mdash;“put your helping
heart with me”&mdash;, when he imitates his predecessors by saying, “yâ,
hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,” at the fourth time aiming the Midē´ sack
at the candidate’s head, and as the mī´gis is supposed to be shot into
it, he falls forward upon the ground, apparently lifeless.</p>

<p>Then the four Midē´ priests, the preceptor and the assistant, lay
their Midē´ sacks upon his back and after a few moments a mī´gis shell
drops from his mouth&mdash;where he had been instructed to retain it.
The chief Midē´ picks up the mī´gis and, holding it between the thumb
and index finger of the right hand, extending his arm toward the
candidate’s mouth says “wâ! wâ! hĕ hĕ hĕ hĕ,” the last syllable being
uttered in a high key and rapidly dropped to a low note; then the same
words are uttered while the mī´gis is held toward the east, and in
regular succession to the south, to the west, to the north, then toward
the sky. During this time the candidate has begun to partially revive
and endeavor to get upon his knees, but when the Midē´ finally places
the mī´gis into his mouth again, he instantly falls upon the ground, as
before. The Midē´ then take up the sacks, each grasping his own as
before, and as they pass around the inanimate body they touch it at
various points, which causes the

“Ō´mishga‘n”<a class = "tag" name = "tagA" id = "tagA" href =

<p>Then, approaching the next in rank, he repeats the ceremony and
continues to do so until he has made the entire circuit of the
Midē´wigân.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this ceremony of rendering thanks to the members
of the society for their presence, the newly elected Midē´ returns to
his place and, after placing within his Midē´ sack his mī´gis, starts
out anew to test his own powers. He approaches the person seated nearest
the eastern entrance, on the south side, and, grasping his sack in a
manner similar to that of the officiating priests, makes threatening
motions toward the Midē´ as if to shoot him, saying, “yâ, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,
hŏ´, hŏ´,” gradually raising his voice to a higher key. At the fourth
movement he makes a quick thrust toward his victim, whereupon the latter
falls forward upon the ground. He then proceeds to the next, who is
menaced in a similar manner and who likewise becomes apparently
unconscious from the powerful effects of the mī´gis. This is continued
until all persons present have been subjected to the influence of the
mī´gis in the possession of the new member. At the third or fourth
experiment the first subject revives and sits up, the others recovering
in regular order a short time after having been “shot at,” as this
procedure is termed.</p>

<p>When all of the Midē´ have recovered a very curious ceremony takes
place. Each one places his mī´gis shell upon the right palm and,
grasping the Midē´ sack with the left hand, moves around the inclosure
and exhibits his mī´gis to everyone present, constantly uttering the
word “hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,” in a quick, low tone. During this period
there is a mingling of all the persons present, each endeavoring to
attract the attention of the others. Each Midē´ then
<span class = "pagenum">218</span>
<a name = "page218" id = "page218"> </a>
<!--png 282-->
pretends to swallow his mī´gis, when suddenly there are sounds of
violent coughing, as if the actors were strangling, and soon thereafter
they gag and spit out upon the ground the mī´gis, upon which each one
falls apparently dead. In a few moments, however, they recover, take up
the little shells again and pretend to swallow them. As the Midē´ return
to their respective places the mī´gis is restored to its receptacle in
the Midē´ sack.</p>

<p>Food is then brought into the Midē´wigân and all partake of it at the
expense of the new member.</p>

<p>After the feast, the older Midē´ of high order, and possibly the
officiating priests, recount the tradition of the Ani´shinâ´bēg and the
origin of the Midē´wiwin, together with speeches relating to the
benefits to be derived through a knowledge thereof, and sometimes, tales
of individual success and exploits. When the inspired ones have given
utterance to their thoughts and feelings, their memories and their
boastings, and the time of adjournment has almost arrived, the new
member gives an evidence of his skill as a singer and a Midē´. Having
acted upon the suggestion of his preceptor, he has prepared some songs
and learned them, and now for the first time the opportunity presents
itself for him to gain admirers and influential friends, a sufficient
number of whom he will require to speak well of him, and to counteract
the evil which will be spoken of him by enemies&mdash;for enemies are
numerous and may be found chiefly among those who are not fitted for the
society of the Midē´, or who have failed to attain the desired
distinction.</p>

<p>The new member, in the absence of a Midē´ drum of his own, borrows
one from a fellow Midē´ and begins to beat it gently, increasing the
strokes in intensity as he feels more and more inspired, then sings a
song (<a href = "#plateXd">Pl. <span class =

<p>As the sun approaches the western horizon, the Midē´ priests emerge
from the western door of the Midē´wigân and go to their respective
wig´iwams, where they partake of their regular evening repast, after
which the remainder of the evening is spent in paying calls upon other
members of the society, smoking, etc.</p>

<p>The preceptor and his assistant return to the Midē´wigân at
nightfall, remove the degree post and plant it at the head of the

DESCRIPTIVE NOTES.</a></h5>

<p>The mī´gis referred to in this description of the initiation consists
of a small white shell, of almost any species, but the one believed to
resemble the form of the mythical mī´gis is similar to the cowrie,
Cypræa moneta, L., and is figured at No. 1 on <a href =
"#plateXI">Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">XI</span></a>. Nearly all
of the shells employed for this purpose are foreign species, and have no
doubt been obtained from the traders. The shells found in the country of
the Ojibwa are of rather delicate structure, and it is probable that the
salt water shells are employed as a substitute chiefly because of their
less frangible character. The mī´gis of the other degrees are presented
on the same plate, but special reference to them will be made. No. 2
represents the mī´gis in the possession of the chief Midē priest of the
society at Leech Lake, Minnesota, and consists of a pearl-white Helix
(sp?).</p>

In <a href = "#fig19">Fig.&nbsp;19</a> is reproduced a curious abnormal
growth which was in the possession of a Midē´ near Red Lake, Minnesota.
It consists of the leg of a Goshawk&mdash;Astur atricapillus,
Wilson&mdash;from the outer inferior condyle of the right tibia of which
had projected a supernumerary leg that terminated in two toes, the whole
abnormality being about one-half the size and length of the natural leg
and toes.</p>

<p>This fetish was highly prized by its former owner, and was believed
to be a medium whereby the favor of the Great Thunderer, or Thunder God,
might be invoked and his anger appeased. This deity is represented in
pictography by the eagle, or frequently by one of the Falconidæ; hence
it is but natural that the superstitious should look with awe and
reverence upon such an abnormality on one of the terrestrial
representatives of this deity.</p>

<p>A Midē´ of the first degree, who may not be enabled to advance
further in the mysteries of the Midē´wiwin, owing to his inability to
procure the necessary quantity of presents and gifts which he is
required to pay to new preceptors and to the officiating
priests&mdash;the latter demanding goods of double the value of those
given as an entrance to the first degree&mdash;may, however, accomplish
the acquisition of additional knowledge by purchasing it from individual
Midē´. It is customary with Midē´ priests to exact payment for every
individual remedy or secret that may be imparted to another who may
desire such information. This practice is not entirely based upon
mercenary motives, but it is firmly believed that when a secret or
remedy has been paid, for it can not be imparted for nothing, as then
its virtue would be impaired, if not entirely destroyed, by the man´idō
or guardian spirit under whose special protection it may be supposed to
be held or controlled.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances certain first degree Midē´ may become
possessed of alleged magic powers which are in reality part of the
accomplishments of the Midē´ of the higher degrees; but, for the mutual
protection of the members of the society, they generally hesitate to
impart anything that may be considered of high value. The usual kind of
knowledge sought consists of the magic properties and use of plants, to
the chief varieties of which reference will be made in connection with
the next degree.</p>

<p>There is one subject, however, which first-degree Midē´ seek
enlightment upon, and that is the preparation of the “hunter’s medicine”
and the pictographic drawings employed in connection therewith. The
compound is made of several plants, the leaves and roots of which are
ground into powder. A little of this is put into the gun barrel, with
the bullet, and sometimes a small pinch is dropped upon the track of the
animal to compel it to halt at whatever place it may be when the powder
is so sprinkled upon the ground.</p>

<p>The method generally employed to give to the hunter success is as
follows: When anyone contemplates making a hunting trip, he first visits
the Midē´, giving him a present of tobacco before announcing
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
<a name = "page222" id = "page222"> </a>
<!--png 288-->
the object of his visit and afterwards promising to give him such and
such portions of the animal which he may procure. The Midē´, if
satisfied with the gift, produces his pipe and after making an offering
to Ki´tshi Man´idō for aid in the preparation of his “medicine,” and to
appease the anger of the man´idō who controls the class of animals
desired, sings a song, one of his own composition, after which he will
draw with a sharp-pointed bone or nail, upon a small piece of birch
bark, the outline of the animal desired by the applicant. The place of
the heart of the animal is indicated by a puncture upon which a small
quantity of vermilion is carefully rubbed, this color being very
efficacious toward effecting the capture of the animal and the punctured
heart insuring its death.</p>

<p>Frequently the heart is indicated by a round or triangular figure,
from which a line extends toward the mouth, generally designated the
life line, i.e., that magic power may reach its heart and influence the
life of the subject designated. <a href = "#fig20">Fig.&nbsp;20</a> is a
reproduction of the character drawn upon a small oval piece of birch
bark, which had been made by a Midē´ to insure the death of two bears.
Another example is presented in <a href = "#fig21">Fig.&nbsp;21</a>, a
variety of animals being figured and a small quantity of vermilion being
rubbed upon the heart of each. In some instances the representation of
animal forms is drawn by the Midē´ not upon birch bark, but directly
upon sandy earth or a bed of ashes, either of which affords a smooth
surface. For this purpose he uses a sharply pointed piece of wood,
thrusts it into the region of the heart, and afterwards sprinkles upon
this a small quantity of powder consisting of magic plants and
vermilion. These performances are not conducted in public, but after the
regular mystic ceremony has been conducted by the Midē´ the information
is delivered with certain injunctions as to the course of procedure,
direction,
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<a name = "page223" id = "page223"> </a>
<!--png 289-->
etc. In the latter method of drawing the outline upon the sand or upon
ashes, the result is made known with such directions as may be deemed
necessary to insure success.</p>

<p>For the purpose of gaining instruction and success in the disposition
of his alleged medicines, the Midē´ familiarizes himself with the
topography and characteristics of the country extending over a wide
area, to ascertain the best feeding grounds of the various animals and
their haunts at various seasons. He keeps himself informed by also
skillfully conducting inquiries of returning hunters, and thus becomes
possessed of a large amount of valuable information respecting the
natural history of the surrounding country, by which means he can, with
a tolerable amount of certainty, direct a hunter to the best localities
for such varieties of game as may be particularly desired by him.</p>

<p>In his incantations a Wâbĕnō´ uses a drum resembling a tambourine. A
hoop made of ash wood is covered with a piece of rawhide, tightly
stretched while wet. Upon the upper surface is painted a mythic figure,
usually that of his tutelaly daimon. An example of this kind is from Red
Lake, Minnesota, presented in <a href = "#fig22">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>. The
human figure is painted red, while the outline of the head is black, as
are also the waving lines extending from the head. These lines denote
superior power. When drumming upon this figure, the Wâbĕnō´ chants and
is thus more easily enabled to invoke the assistance of his man´idō.</p>

<p>Women, as before remarked, may take the degrees of the Midē´wiwin,
but, so far as could be ascertained, their professions pertain chiefly
to the treatment of women and children and to tattooing for the cure of
headache and chronic neuralgia.</p>

<p>Tattooing is accomplished by the use of finely powdered charcoal,
soot or gunpowder, the pricking instrument being made by tying together
a small number of needles; though formerly, it is said, fish spines or
sharp splinters of bone were used for the purpose. The marks consist of
round spots of one-half to three-fourths of an inch in diameter
immediately over the afflicted part, the intention being to drive out
the demon. Such spots are usually found upon the temples, though an
occasional one may be found on the forehead or over the nasal
eminence.</p>

<p>When the pain extends over considerable space the tattoo marks are
smaller, and are arranged in rows or continuous lines. Such marks may be
found upon some individuals to run outward over either or both cheeks
from the alæ of the nose to a point near the
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<a name = "page224" id = "page224"> </a>
<!--png 290-->
lobe of the ear, clearly indicating that the tattooing was done for
toothache or neuralgia.</p>

<p>The female Midē´ is usually present at the initiation of new members,
but her duties are mainly to assist in the singing and to make herself
generally useful in connection with the preparation of the medicine
feast.</p>


<h4 class = "section"><a name = "second" id = "second">SECOND
DEGREE.</a></h4>

<p>The inclosure within which the second degree of the Midē´wiwin is
conferred, resembles in almost every respect that of the first, the only
important difference being that there are two degree posts instead of
one. A diagram is presented in <a href = "#fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>. The
first post is planted a short distance beyond the middle of the
floor&mdash;toward the western door&mdash;and is similar to the post of
the first degree, i.e., red, with a band of green around the top, upon
which is perched the stuffed body of an owl; the kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´. The
second post, of similar size, is painted red, and over the entire
surface of it are spots of white made by applying clay with the finger
tips. (<a href = "#plateXV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XV</span></a>, No.&nbsp;2.) These spots are symbolical of
the sacred mī´gis, the great number of them denoting increased power of
the magic influence which fills the Midē´wigân. A small cedar tree is
also planted at each of the outer angles of the inclosure.</p>

<p>The sweat-lodge, as before, is erected at some distance east of the
main entrance of the Midē´wigân, but a larger structure is arranged upon
a similar plan; more ample accommodations must be provided to permit a
larger gathering of Midē´ priests during the period of preparation and
instruction of the candidate.</p>

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "second_prep" id = "second_prep">
PREPARATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>A Midē´ of the first degree is aware of the course to be pursued by
him when he contemplates advancement into the next higher grade. Before
making known to the other members his determination, he is compelled to
procure, either by purchase or otherwise, such a quantity of blankets,
robes, peltries, and other articles of apparel or ornament as will
amount in value to twice the sum at which were estimated the gifts
presented at his first initiation. A year or more usually elapses before
this can be accomplished, as but one hunting season intervenes before
the next annual meeting of the society, when furs are in their prime;
and fruits and maple sugar can be gathered but once during the season,
and these may be converted into money with which to purchase presents
not always found
<span class = "pagenum">225</span>
<a name = "page225" id = "page225"> </a>
<!--png 291-->
at the Indian traders´ stores. Friends may be called upon to advance
goods to effect the accomplishment of his desire, but such loans must be
returned in kind later on, unless otherwise agreed. When a candidate
feels convinced that he has gathered sufficient material to pay for his
advancement, he announces to those members of the society who are of a
higher grade than the first degree that he wishes to present himself at
the proper time for initiation. This communication is made to eight of
the highest or officiating priests, in his own wig´iwam, to which they
have been specially invited. A feast is prepared and partaken of, after
which he presents to each some tobacco, and smoking is indulged in for
the purpose of making proper offerings, as already described. The
candidate then informs his auditors of his desire and enumerates the
various goods and presents which he has procured to offer at the proper
time. The Midē´ priests sit in silence and meditate; but as they have
already been informally aware of the applicant’s wish, they are prepared
as to the answer they will give, and are governed according to the
estimated value of the gifts. Should the decision of the Midē´ priests
be favorable, the candidate procures the services of one of those
present to assume the office of instructor or preceptor, to whom, as
well as to the officiating priests, he displays his ability in his
adopted specialties in medical magic, etc. He seeks, furthermore, to
acquire additional information upon the preparation of certain secret
remedies, and to this end he selects a preceptor who has the reputation
of possessing&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>For acting in the capacity of instructor, a Midē´ priest receives
blankets, horses, and whatever may be mutually agreed upon between
himself and his pupil. The meetings take place at the instructor’s
wig´iwam at intervals of a week or two; and sometimes during the autumn
months, preceding the summer in which the initiation is to be conferred,
the candidate is compelled to resort to a sudatory and take a vapor
bath, as a means of purgation preparatory to his serious consideration
of the sacred rites and teachings with which his mind “and heart” must
henceforth be occupied, to the exclusion of everything that might tend
to divert his thoughts.</p>

<p>What the special peculiarities and ceremonials of initiation into the
second degree may have been in former times, it is impossible to
ascertain at this late day. The only special claims for benefits to be
derived through this advancement, as well as into the third and fourth
degrees, are, that a Midē´ upon his admission into a new degree receives
the protection of that Man´idō alleged and believed to be the special
guardian of such degree, and that the repetition of initiation adds to
the magic powers previously received by the initiate. In the first
degree the sacred mīgis was “shot” into the two sides, the heart, and
head of the candidate, whereas in the second degree this sacred, or
magic, influence, is directed by the priests
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<a name = "page226" id = "page226"> </a>
<!--png 292-->
toward the candidate’s joints, in accordance with a belief entertained
by some priests and referred to in connection with the Red Lake chart
presented on <a href = "#plateIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">III</span></a>. The second, third, and fourth degrees are
practically mere repetitions of the first, and the slight differences
between them are noted under their respective captions.</p>

<p>In addition to a recapitulation of the secrets pertaining to the
therapeutics of the Midē´, a few additional magic remedies are taught
the candidate in his preparatory instruction. The chief of these are
described below.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
Ma-kwa´ wī´-i-sŏp, “Bear’s Gall,” and Pi´-zhi-ki wī´-i-sŏp, “Ox Gall,”
are both taken from the freshly killed animal and hung up to dry. It is
powdered as required, and a small pinch of it is dissolved in water, a
few drops of which are dropped into the ear of a patient suffering from
earache.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
Gō´-gi-mish (gen. et sp.?).&mdash;A plant, described by the preceptor as
being about 2 feet in height, having black bark and clusters of small
red flowers.</p>

<p class = "hanging two">
1. The bark is scraped from the stalk, crushed and dried. When it is to
be used the powder is put into a small bag of cloth and soaked in hot
water to extract the virtue. It is used to expel evil man´idōs which
cause obstinate coughs, and is also administered to consumptives. The
quantity of bark derived from eight stems, each 10 inches long, makes a
large dose. When a Midē´ gives this medicine to a patient, he fills his
pipe and smokes, and before the tobacco is all consumed the patient
vomits.</p>

<p class = "hanging two">
2. The root of this plant mixed with the following is used to produce
paralysis of the mouth. In consequence of the power it possesses it is
believed to be under the special protection of the Midē´ Man´idō, i.e.,
Ki´tshi Man´idō.</p>

<p class = "hanging two">
The compound is employed also to counteract the evil intentions,
conjurations, or other charms of so-called bad Midē´, Wâbĕnō´, and
Jĕs´sakkīd´.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
Tzhi-bē´-gŏp&mdash;“Ghost Leaf.”</p>

<p class = "hanging two">
After the cuticle is removed from the roots the thick under-bark is
crushed into a powder. It is mixed with Gō´gimish.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
Dzhi-bai´-ĕ-mŏk´-ke-zĭn´&mdash;“Ghost Moccasin;” “Puff-ball.”</p>

<p class = "hanging two">
The spore-dust of the ball is carefully reserved to add to the above
mixture.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
O-kwē´-mish&mdash;“Bitter Black Cherry.”</p>

<p class = "hanging two">
The inner bark of branches dried and crushed is also added.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
Nē´-wĕ&mdash;“Rattlesnake” (<i>Crotalus durissus, L.</i>).</p>

<p class = "hanging two">
The reptile is crushed and the blood collected, dried, and used in a
pulverulent form. After partially crushing the body it is hung up and
the drippings collected and dried. Other snakes may be employed as a
substitute.</p>

<p>It is impossible to state the nature of the plants mentioned in the
above compound, as they are not indigenous to the vicinity of White
Earth, Minnesota, but are procured from Indians living in the eastern
extremity of the State and in Wisconsin. Poisonous plants are of rare
occurrence in this latitude, and if any actual poisonous properties
exist in the mixture they may be introduced by the Indian himself, as
strychnia is frequently to be purchased at almost any of the stores, to
be used in the extermination of noxious animals. Admitting that crotalus
venom may be present, the introduction into the human circulation of
this substance would without doubt produce death and not paralysis of
the facial muscles, and if taken into the stomach it quickly undergoes
chemical change when brought in contact with the gastric juice, as is
well known
<span class = "pagenum">227</span>
<a name = "page227" id = "page227"> </a>
<!--png 295-->
from experiments made by several well known physiologists, and
particularly by Dr. Coxe (Dispensatory, 1839), who employed the contents
of the venom sack, mixed with bread, for the cure of rheumatism.</p>

<p>I mention this because of my personal knowledge of six cases at White
Earth, in which paralysis of one side of the face occurred soon after
the Midē´ administered this compound. In nearly all of them the
distortion disappeared after a lapse of from six weeks to three months,
though one is known to have continued for several years with no signs of
recovery. The Catholic missionary at White Earth, with whom conversation
was held upon this subject, feels impressed that some of the so-called
“bad Midē´” have a knowledge of some substance, possibly procured from
the whites, which they attempt to employ in the destruction of enemies,
rivals, or others. It may be possible that the instances above referred
to were cases in which the dose was not sufficient to kill the victim,
but was enough to disable him temporarily. Strychnia is the only
substance attainable by them that could produce such symptoms, and then
only when given in an exceedingly small dose. It is also alleged by
almost every one acquainted with the Ojibwa that they do possess
poisons, and that they employ them when occasion demands in the removal
of personal enemies or the enemies of those who amply reward the Midē´
for such service.</p>

<p>When the time of ceremony of initiation approaches, the chief Midē´
priest sends out a courier to deliver to each member an invitation to
attend (<a href = "#plateXII">Pl.&nbsp;<span class =

to the vicinity of the place where the Midē´wigân has been erected. On
the fifth day before the celebration he visits the sweat-lodge, where he
takes his first vapor bath, followed on the next by another; on the
following day he takes the third bath, after which his preceptor visits
him. After making an offering to Ki´tshi Man´iō the priest sings a song,
of which the characters are reproduced in <a href = "#plateXIIIa">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XIII</span>,&nbsp;A</a>. The Ojibwa words
employed in singing are given in the first lines, and are said to be the
ancient phraseology as taught for many generations. They are archaic, to
a great extent, and have additional meaningless syllables inserted, and
used as suffixes which are intoned to prolong notes. The second line of
the Ojibwa text consists of the words as they are spoken at the present
time, to each of which is added the interpretation. The radical
similarity between the two is readily perceived.</p>

guardian spirit of the second degree of the Midē´wiwin. After the usual
ceremony of smoking individual songs are indulged in by the Midē´
priests until such time as they may deem it necessary to proceed to the
Midē´wigân, where the members of the society have long since gathered
and around which is scattered the usual crowd of spectators. The
candidate leads the procession from the sweat-lodge to the eastern
entrance of the Midē´wigân, carrying an ample supply of tobacco and
followed by the priests who chant. When the head of the procession
arrives at the door of the sacred inclosure a halt is made, the priests
going forward and entering. The drummer, stationed within, begins to
drum and sing, while the preceptor and chief officiating priest continue
their line of march around the inclosure, going by way of the south or
left hand. Eight circuits are made, the last terminating at the main or
eastern entrance. The drumming then ceases and the candidate is taken to
the inner side of the door, when all the members rise and stand in their
places. The officiating priests approach and stand near the middle of
the inclosure, facing the candidate, when one of them says to the Midē´
priest beside the latter: O-da´-pin a-sē´-ma&mdash;“Take it, the
tobacco,” whereupon the Midē´ spoken to relieves the candidate of the
tobacco and carries it to the middle of the inclosure, where it is laid
upon a blanket spread upon the ground. The preceptor then takes from the
cross-poles some of the blankets or robes and gives them to the
candidate to hold. One of the malevolent spirits which oppose the
entrance of a stranger is still supposed to remain with the Midē´wigân,
its body being that of a serpent, like flames of fire, reaching from the
earth to the sky. He is called I´-shi-ga-nē´-bĭ-gŏg&mdash;“Big-Snake.”
To appease his anger the candidate must make a present; so the preceptor
says for the candidate:</p>

<p>This being assented to by the Midē´ priests the preceptor takes the
blankets and deposits them near the tobacco upon the ground. Slight taps
upon the Midē´ drum are heard and the candidate is led
<span class = "pagenum">232</span>
<a name = "page232" id = "page232"> </a>
<!--png 302-->
toward the left on his march round the interior of the Midē´wigân, the
officiating priests following and being followed in succession by all
others present. The march continues until the eighth passage round, when
the members begin to step back into their respective places, while the
officiating Midē´ finally station themselves with their backs toward the
westernmost degree post, and face the door at the end of the structure.
The candidate continues round to the western end, faces the Midē´
priests, and all sit down. The following song is then sung, which may be
the individual production of the candidate (<a href = "#plateXIIIc">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XIII</span>,&nbsp;C</a>). A song is part of
the ritual, though it is not necessary that the candidate should sing
it, as the preceptor may do so for him. In the instance under my
observation the song was an old one (which had been taught the
candidate), as the archaic form of pronunciation indicates. Each of the
lines is repeated as often as the singer may desire, the prolongation of
the song being governed by his inspired condition. The same peculiarity
governs the insertion, between words and at the end of lines, of
apparently meaningless vowel sounds, to reproduce and prolong the last
notes sounded. This may be done ad libitum, rythmical accentuation being
maintained by gently tapping upon the Midē´ drum.</p>

<p>As each of the preceding lines or verses is sung in such a protracted
manner as to appear like a distinct song, the dancers, during the
intervals of rest, always retire to their places and sit down.

The dancing is not so energetic as many of those commonly indulged in
for amusement only. The steps consist of two treading movements made by
each foot in succession. Keeping time with the drum-beats, at the same
time there is a shuffling movement made by the dancer forward, around
and among his companions, but getting back toward his place before the
verse is ended. The attitude during these movements consists in bending
the body forward, while the knees are bent, giving one the appearance of
searching for a lost object. Those who do not sing give utterance to
short, deep grunts, in accordance with the alternate heavier strokes
upon the drum.</p>

<p>As the dancing ceases, and all are in their proper seats, the
preceptor, acting for the candidate, approaches the pile of tobacco and
distributes a small quantity to each one present, when smoking is
indulged in, preceded by the usual offering to the east, the south, the
west, the north, the sky and the earth.</p>

<p>After the completion of this ceremonial an attendant carries the
Midē´ drum to the southeast angle of the inclosure, where it is
delivered to the drummer; then the officiating priests rise and approach
within two or three paces of the candidate as he gets upon his knees.
The preceptor and the assistant who is called upon by him take their
places immediately behind and to either side of the candidate, and the
Midē´ priest lowest in order of precedence begins to utter quick, deep
tones, resembling the sound hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, at the same time
grasping his midē´ sack with both hands, as if it were a gun, and moving
it in a serpentine and interrupted manner toward one of the large joints
of the candidate’s arms or legs. At the last utterance of this sound he
produces a quick puff with the breath and thrusts the bag forward as if
shooting, which he pretends to do, the missile being supposed to be the
invisible sacred mī´gis. The other priests follow in order from the
lowest to the highest, each selecting a different joint, during which
ordeal the candidate trembles more and more violently until at last he
is overcome with the magic influence and falls forward upon the ground
unconscious. The Midē´ priests then lay their sacks upon his back, when
the candidate begins to recover and spit out the mī´gis shell which he
had previously hidden within his mouth. Then the chief Midē´ takes it up
between the tips of the forefinger and thumb and goes through the
ceremony described in connection with the initiation into the first
degree, of holding it toward the east, south, west, north, and the sky,
and finally to the mouth of the candidate, when the latter, who has
partly recovered from his apparently insensible condition, again
relapses into that state. The eight priests then place their sacks to
the respective joints at which they previously directed them, which
fully infuses the body with the magic influence as desired. Upon this
the candidate recovers, takes up the mī´gis shell and, placing it upon
his left palm, holds it forward and swings it from side to side, saying
he!

he! he! he! he! and pretends to swallow it, this time only reeling from
its effects. He is now restored to a new life for the second time; and
as the priests go to seek seats he is left on the southern side and
seats himself. After all those who have been occupied with the
initiation have hung up their midē´ sacks on available projections
against the wall or branches, the new member goes forward to the pile of
tobacco, blankets, and other gifts and divides them among those present,
giving the larger portions to the officiating priests. He then passes
around once more, stopping before each one to pass his hands over the
sides of the priests´ heads, and says:</p>

<p>to which each responds hau´, ē<sup>n</sup>. The word hau´ is a term
of approbation, ē<sup>n</sup> signifying yes, or affirmation, the two
thus used together serving to intensify the expression. Those of the
Midē´ present who are of the second, or even some higher degree, then
indulge in the ceremony of passing around to the eastern part of the
inclosure, where they feign coughing and gagging, so as to produce from
the mouth the mī´gis shell, as already narrated in connection with the
first degree, p. 192.</p>

<p>This manner of thanking the officiating Midē´ for their services in
initiating the candidate into a higher degree is extended also to those
members of the Midē´wiwin who are of the first degree only, in
acknowledgment of the favor of their presence at the ceremony, they
being eligible to attend ceremonial rites of any degree higher than the
class to which they belong, because such men are neither benefited nor
influenced in any way by merely witnessing such initiation, but they
must themselves take the principal part in it to receive the favor of a
renewed life and to become possessed of higher power and increased magic
influence.</p>

<p>Various members of the society indulge in short harangues, recounting
personal exploits in the performance of magic and exorcism, to which the
auditors respond in terms of gratification and exclamations of approval.
During these recitals the ushers, appointed for the purpose, leave the
inclosure by the western door to return in a short time with kettles of
food prepared for the midē´ feast. The ushers make four circuits of the
interior, giving to each person present a quantity of the contents of
the several vessels, so that all receive sufficient to gratify their
desires. When the last of the food has been consumed, or removed, the
midē´ drum is heard, and soon a song is started, in which all who desire
join. After the first two or three verses of the song are recited, a
short interval of
<span class = "pagenum">236</span>

rest is taken, but when it is resumed dancing begins and is continued to
the end. In this manner they indulge in singing and dancing,
interspersed with short speeches, until the approach of sunset, when the
members retire to their own wig´iwams, leaving the Midē´-wigân by the
western egress.</p>

<p>The ushers, assisted by the chief Midē´, then remove the sacred post
from the inclosure and arrange the interior for new initiations, either
of a lower or higher class, if candidates have prepared and presented
themselves. In case there is no further need of meeting again at once,
the members of the society and visitors return upon the following day to
their respective homes.</p>

DESCRIPTIVE NOTES.</a></h5>

<p>The mī´gis shell employed in the second degree initiation is of the
same species as those before mentioned. At White Earth, however, some of
the priests claim an additional shell as characteristic of this advanced
degree, and insist that this should be as nearly round as possible,
having a perforation through it by which it may be secured with a strand
or sinew. In the absence of a rounded white shell a bead may be used as
a substitute. On <a href = "#plateXI">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XI</span></a>, No. 4, is presented an illustration of the
bead (the second-degree <ins class = "correction"

occasion of my initiation.</p>

<p>With reference to the style of facial decoration resorted to in this
degree nearly all of the members now paint the face according to their
own individual tastes, though a few old men still adhere to the
traditional method previously described (pp. 180, 181). The candidate
usually adopts the style practiced by his preceptor, to which he is
officially entitled; but if the preceptor employed in the preparatory
instruction for the second degree be not the same individual whose
services were retained for the first time, then the candidate has the
privilege of painting his face according to the style of the preceding
degree. If he follow his last preceptor it is regarded as an exceptional
token of respect, and the student is not expected to follow the method
in his further advancement.</p>

<p>A Midē´ of the second degree is also governed by his tutelary daimon;
e.g., if during the first fast and vision he saw a bear, he now prepares
a necklace of bear-claws, which is worn about the neck and crosses the
middle of the breast. He now has the power of changing his form into
that of a bear; and during that term of his disguise he wreaks vengeance
upon his detractors and upon victims for whose destruction he has been
liberally rewarded. Immediately upon the accomplishment of such an act
he resumes his human form and thus escapes identification and detection.
Such persons are termed by many “bad medicine men,” and the practice of
thus debasing the sacred teachings of the Midē´wiwin is discountenanced
by members of the society generally. Such pretensions are firmly
believed in
<span class = "pagenum">237</span>

and acknowledged by the credulous and are practiced by that class of
Shamans here designated as the Wâbĕnō´.</p>

<p>In his history<a class = "tag" href = "#note15" name = "tag15" id =
"tag15">15</a> Rev. Mr. Jones says:</p>

<blockquote>As the powwows always unite witchcraft with the application
of their medicines I shall here give a short account of this curious
art.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Witches and wizards are persons supposed to possess the
agency of familiar spirits from whom they receive power to inflict
diseases on their enemies, prevent good luck of the hunter and the
success of the warrior. They are believed to fly invisibly at pleasure
from place to place; to turn themselves into bears, wolves, foxes, owls,
bats, and snakes. Such metamorphoses they pretend to accomplish by
putting on the skins of these animals, at the same time crying and
howling in imitation of the creature they wish to represent. Several of
our people have informed me that they have seen and heard witches in the
shape of these animals, especially the bear and the fox. They say that
when a witch in the shape of a bear is being chased all at once she will
run round a tree or a hill, so as to be lost sight of for a time by her
pursuers, and then, instead of seeing a bear they behold an old woman
walking quietly along or digging up roots, and looking as innocent as a
lamb. The fox witches are known by the flame of fire which proceeds out
of their mouths every time they bark.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Many receive the name of witches without making any
pretensions to the art, merely because they are deformed or ill-looking.
Persons esteemed witches or wizards are generally eccentric characters,
remarkably wicked, of a ragged appearance and forbidding countenance.
The way in which they are made is either by direct communication with
the familiar spirit during the days of their fasting, or by being
instructed by those skilled in the art.</blockquote>

<p>A Midē´ of the second degree has the reputation of superior powers on
account of having had the mī´gis placed upon all of his joints, and
especially because his heart is filled with magic power, as is shown in
<a href = "#plateIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">III</span></a>, No.
48. In this drawing the disk upon the breast denotes where the mī´gis
has been “shot” into the figure, the enlarged size of the circle
signifying “greater abundance,” in contradistinction to the common
designation of a mī´gis shown only by a simple spot or small point. One
of this class is enabled to hear and see what is transpiring at a remote
distance, the lines from the hands indicating that he is enabled to
grasp objects which are beyond the reach of a common person, and the
lines extending from the feet signifying that he can traverse space and
transport himself to the most distant points. Therefore he is sought
after by hunters for aid in the discovery and capture of game, for
success in war, and for the destruction of enemies, however remote may
be their residence.</p>

<p>When an enemy or a rival is to be dealt with a course is pursued
similar to that followed when preparing hunting charts, though more
powerful magic medicines are used. In the following description of a
pictograph recording such an occurrence the Midē´, or rather the
Wâbĕnō´, was of the fourth degree of the Midē´wiwin. The indication of
the grade of the operator is not a necessary part of the record, but in
this instance appears to have been prompted
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>

from motives of vanity. The original sketch, of which <a href =
"#fig24">Fig.&nbsp;24</a> is a reproduction, was drawn upon birch-bark
by a Midē´, in 1884, and the ceremony detailed actually occurred at
White Earth, Minnesota. By a strange coincidence the person against whom
vengeance was aimed died of pneumonia the following spring, the disease
having resulted from cold contracted during the preceding winter. The
victim resided at a camp more than a hundred miles east of the locality
above named, and his death was attributed to the Midē´’s power, a
reputation naturally procuring for him many new adherents and disciples.
The following is the explanation as furnished by a Midē´ familiar with
the circumstances:</p>

<p>War parties are not formed at this time, but mnemonic charts of songs
used by priests to encourage war parties, are still extant, and a
reproduction of one is given on <a href = "#plateXIIId">Pl. <span class
= "smallroman">XIII</span>,&nbsp;D</a>. This song was used by the Midē´
priest to insure success to the parties. The members who intended
participating in the exhibition would meet on the evening preceding
their departure, and while listening to the words, some would join in
the singing while others would dance. The lines may be repeated ad
libitum so as to lengthen the entire series of phrases according to the
prevalent enthusiasm and the time at the disposal of the performers. The
war drum was used, and there were always five or six drummers so as to
produce sufficient noise to accord with the loud and animated singing of
a large body of excited men. This drum is, in size, like that employed
for dancing. It is made by covering with rawhide an old kettle, or
wooden vessel, from 2 to 3 feet in diameter. The drum is then attached
to four sticks, or short posts, so as to prevent its touching the
ground, thus affording every advantage for producing full and resonant
sounds, when struck. The drumsticks are strong withes, at the end of
each of which is fastened a ball of buckskin thongs. The following lines
are repeated ad libitum:</p>

<p>The structure in which the third degree of the Midē´wiwin is
conferred resembles that of the two preceding, and an outline is
presented in <a href = "#fig25">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>. In this degree three
posts are erected, the first one resembling that of the first degree,
being painted red with a band of green around the top. (<a href =

This is planted a short distance to the east of the middle of the floor.
The second post is also painted red, but has scattered over its entire
surface spots of white clay, each of about the size of a silver quarter
of a dollar, symbolical of the mī´gis shell. Upon the top of this post
is placed the stuffed body of an owl&mdash;Kŏ-kó-kŏ-ō´. (<a href =

Cedar trees are planted at each of the outer angles of the structure (<a

PREPARATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>It is customary for the period of one year to elapse before a
second-degree Midē´ can be promoted, even if he be provided with enough
presents for such advancement. As the exacted fee consists of goods and
tobacco thrice the value of the fee for the first degree, few present
themselves. This degree is not held in as high estimation, relatively,
as the preceding one; but it is alleged that a Midē´’s powers are
intensified by again subjecting himself to the ceremony of being “shot
with the sacred mī´gis,” and he is also elevated to that rank by means
of which he may be enabled the better to invoke the assistance of the
tutelary guardian of this degree.</p>

<p>A Midē´ who has in all respects complied with the preliminaries of
announcing to the chief Midē´ his purpose, gaining satisfactory evidence
of his resources and ability to present the necessary presents, and of
his proficiency in the practice of medical magic, etc., selects a
preceptor of at least the third degree and one who is held in high
repute and influence in the Midē´wiwin. After procuring the services of
such a person and making a satisfactory agreement with him, he may be
enabled to purchase from him some special formulæ for which he is
distinguished. The instruction embraces a résumé of the traditions
previously given, the various uses and properties of magic plants and
compounds with which the preceptor is familiar, and conversations
relative to exploits performed in medication, incantation, and exorcism.
Sometimes the candidate is enabled to acquire new “medicines” to add to
his list, and the following is a translation of the tradition relating
to the origin of ginseng (Aralia quinquefolia, Gr.), the so-called “man
root,” held in high estimation as of divine origin. In <a href =
"#fig3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a> is presented a pictorial representation of the
story, made by Ojibwa, a Midē´ priest of White Earth, Minnesota. The
tradition purports to be an account of a visit of the spirit of a boy to
the abode of Dzhibai´Man´idō, “the chief spirit of the place of souls,”
called Ne´-ba-gi´-zis, “the land of the sleeping sun.”</p>

<p>There appears to be some similarity between this tradition and that
given in connection with <a href = "#plateV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">V</span></a>, in which the Sun Spirit restored to life a
boy, by which act he exemplified a portion of the ritual of the
Midē´wiwin. It is probable therefore that the following tradition is a
corruption of the former and made to account for the origin of “man
root,” as ginseng is designated, this root, or certain portions of it,
being so extensively employed in various painful complaints.</p>

<blockquote>Once an old Midē´, with his wife and son, started out on a
hunting trip, and, as the autumn was changing into winter, the three
erected a substantial wig´iwam. The snow began to fall and the cold
increased, so they decided to remain and eat of their stores, game
having been abundant and a good supply having been procured.
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<a name = "page242" id = "page242"> </a>
<!--png 316-->
The son died; whereupon his mother immediately set out for the village
to obtain help to restore him to life, as she believed her father, the
chief priest of the Midē´-wiwin, able to accomplish this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the woman informed her father of the death of her son,
her brother, who was present, immediately set out in advance to render
assistance. The chief priest then summoned three assistant Midē´, and
they accompanied his daughter to the place where the body of his dead
grandson lay upon the floor of the wig´iwam, covered with
robes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The chief Midē´ placed himself at the left shoulder of the
dead boy, the next in rank at the right, while the two other assistants
stationed themselves at the feet. Then the youngest Midē´&mdash;he at
the right foot of the deceased&mdash;began to chant a midē´ song, which
he repeated a second, a third, and a fourth time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When he had finished, the Midē´ at the left foot sang a
midē´ song four times; then the Midē´ at the right shoulder of the body
did the same, after which the chief Midē´ priest sang his song four
times, whereupon there was a perceptible movement under the blanket, and
as the limbs began to move the blanket was taken off, when the boy sat
up. Being unable to speak, he made signs that he desired water, which
was given to him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The four Midē´ priests then chanted medicine songs, each
preparing charmed remedies which were given to the boy to complete his
recovery. The youngest Midē´, standing at the foot of the patient, gave
him four pinches of powder, which he was made to swallow; the Midē´ at
the left foot did the same; then the Midē´ at the right shoulder did
likewise, and he, in turn, was followed by the chief priest standing at
the left shoulder of the boy; whereupon the convalescent immediately
recovered his speech and said that during the time that his body had
been in a trance his spirit had been in the “spirit land,” and had
learned of the “grand medicine.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>The boy then narrated what his spirit had experienced during
the trance, as follows: “Gi´-gi-min´-ĕ-go´-min mi-dē´-wi-wĭn mi-dē´

<p>The following is a translation:</p>

<blockquote><ins class = "correction" title =
"open quote missing">“</ins>He,
the chief spirit of the Midē´ Society, gave us the
“grand medicine,” and he has taught us how to use it. I have come back
from the spirit land. There will be twelve, all of whom will take wives;
when the last of these is no longer without a wife, then will I die.
That is the time. The Midē´ spirit taught us to do right. He gave us
life and told us how to prolong it. These things he taught us, and gave
us roots for medicine. I give to you medicine; if your head is sick,
this medicine put upon it, you will put it on.”</blockquote>

<p>The revelation received by the boy was in the above manner imparted
to the Indians. The reference to twelve&mdash;three times the sacred
number four&mdash;signifies that twelve chief priests shall succeed each
other before death will come to the narrator. It is observed, also, that
a number of the words are archaic, which fact appears to be an
indication of some antiquity, at least, of the tradition.</p>

Aralia quinquefolia, Gr., ginseng&mdash;Shtĕ´-na-bi-o´-dzhi-bik:</p>

the bifurcations of the root are employed; should the pains be in the

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "third_init" id = "third_init">
INITIATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>As the candidate for promotion has acquired from his Midē´ friends
such new information as they choose to impart, and from his instructor
all that was practicable, he has only to await the day of ceremony to be
publicly acknowledged as a third-degree Midē´. As this time approaches
the invitation sticks are sent to the various members and to such
non-resident Midē´ as the officiating priests may wish to honor. On or
before the fifth day previous to the meeting the candidate moves to the
vicinity of the Midē´wigân. On that day the first sweat bath is taken,
and one also upon each succeeding day until four baths, as a ceremony of
purification, have been indulged in. On the evening of the day before
the meeting his preceptor visits him at his own wig´iwam when, with the
assistance of friends, the presents are collected and carried to the
Midē´-wigân and suspended from the transverse poles near the roof. The
officiating priests may subsequently join him, when smoking and singing
form the chief entertainment of the evening.</p>

<p>By this time numerous visitors have gathered together and are
encamped throughout the adjacent timber, and the sound of the drum,
where dancing is going on, may be heard far into the night.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the day of the ceremonies the candidate goes
to the sudatory where he first awaits the coming of his preceptor and
later the arrival of the Midē´ priests by whom he is escorted to the
Midē´wigân. With the assistance of the preceptor he arranges his gift of
tobacco which he takes with him to the sacred inclosure, after which a
smoke offering is made, and later Midē´ songs are chanted. These may be
of his own composition as he has been a professor of magic a sufficient
lapse of time to have composed them, but to give evidence of superior
powers the chief, or some other of the officiating priests, will perhaps
be sufficiently inspired to sing. The following was prepared and chanted
by one of the Midē´ priests at the third-degree meeting at White Earth,
Minnesota, and the illustration in <ins class = "correction" title =

<p>All the members of the society not officially inducting the candidate
have ere this entered the Midē´wigân and deposited their invitation
sticks near the sacred stone, or, in the event of their inability

to attend, have sent them with an explanation. The candidate, at the
suggestion of the Midē´ priest, then prepares to leave the sudatory,
gathers up the tobacco, and as he slowly advances toward the Midē´
inclosure his attendants fall into the procession according to their
office. The priests sing as they go forward, until they reach the
entrance of the Midē´wigân, where the candidate and his preceptor halt,
while the remainder enter and take their stations just within the door,
facing the west.</p>

<p>The drummers, who are seated in the southwestern angle of the
inclosure, begin to drum and sing, while the candidate is led slowly
around the exterior, going by the south, thus following the course of
the sun. Upon the completion of the fourth circuit he is halted directly
opposite the main entrance, to which his attention is then directed. The
drumming and singing cease; the candidate beholds two Midē´ near the
outer entrance and either side of it. These Midē´ represent two
malevolent man´idō and guard the door against the entrance of those not
duly prepared. The one upon the northern side of the entrance then
addresses his companion in the following words: I´-ku-tan ka´-wi-nad´-gĭ
wa´-na-mâ´-sĭ ē´-zhĭ-gĭ´-nĭ-gĕd&mdash;“Do you not see how he is formed?”
To which the other responds: O-da´-pĭ-nŏ´ ke´-no-wĭn-dŭng
shkwan´-dĭm&mdash;“Take care of it, the door;” [i.e., guard the
entrance.] The former then again speaks to his companion, and says:
Ka-wīn´-nĭ-na-ga´ wâ´-ba-ma´-si-ba´-shĭ-gi´-ne-gēt´&mdash;“Do you not
see how he carries the goods?” The Midē´ spoken to assents to this, when
the preceptor takes several pieces of tobacco which he presents to the
two guards, whereupon they permit the candidate to advance to the inner
entrance, where he is again stopped by two other guardian man´idō, who
turn upon him as if to inquire the reason of his intrusion. The
candidate then holds out two parcels of tobacco and says to them:
O-da´-pin a-sē´-ma&mdash;“Take it, the tobacco,” whereupon they receive
the gift and stand aside, saying: Kun´-da-dan&mdash;“Go down;” [i.e.,
enter and follow the path.] As the candidate is taken a few steps
forward and toward the sacred stone, four of the eight officiating
priests receive him, one replacing the preceptor who goes to the extreme
western end there to stand and face the east, where another joins him,
while the remaining two place themselves side by side so as to face the
west.</p>

<p>It is believed that there are five powerful man´idōs who abide within
the third-degree Midē´wigân, one of whom is the Midē´
man´idō&mdash;Ki´tshi Man´idō&mdash;one being present at the sacred
stone, the second at that part of the ground between the sacred stone
and the first part where the gifts are deposited, the remaining three at
the three degree posts.</p>

<p>As the candidate starts and continues upon his walk around the
interior of the inclosure the musicians begin to sing and drum, while
all those remaining are led toward the left, and when opposite the

sacred stone he faces it and is turned round so that his back is not
toward it in passing; the same is done at the second place where one of
the spirits is supposed to abide; again at first, second, and third
posts. By this time the candidate is at the western extremity of the
structure, and as the second Midē´ receives him in charge, the other
taking his station beside the preceptor, he continues his course toward
the north and east to the point of departure, going through similar
evolutions as before, as he passes the three posts, the place of gifts
and the sacred stone. This is done as an act of reverence to the
man´idōs and to acknowledge his gratitude for their presence and
encouragement. When he again arrives at the eastern extremity of the
inclosure he is placed between the two officiating Midē´, who have been
awaiting his return, while his companion goes farther back, even to the
door, from which point he addresses the other officiating Midē´ as
follows:</p>

<p>Then one of the Midē´ priests standing beside the candidate leads him
to the spot between the sacred stone and the first-degree post where the
blankets and other goods have been deposited, and here he is seated.
This priest then walks slowly around him singing in a tremulous manner
wa´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, returning to a position so as to
face him, when he addresses him as follows: Mĭs-sa´-a-shi´-gwa

<blockquote>The time has arrived for you to ask of the Great Spirit this
“reverence” i.e., the sanctity of this degree. I am interceding in your
behalf, but you think my powers are feeble; I am asking him to confer
upon you the sacred powers. He may cause many to die, but I shall
henceforth watch your course of success in life, and learn if he will
heed your prayers and recognize your magic power.</blockquote>

<p>At the conclusion of these remarks three others of the officiating
Midē´ advance and seat themselves, with their chief, before the
candidate. The Midē´ drum is handed to the chief priest, and after a
short prelude of drumming he becomes more and more inspired, and sings

<p>This song is sung ad libitum according to the inspired condition of
the person singing it. Many of the words are archaic, and differ from
the modern forms.</p>

<p>Then the officiating priests arise and the one lowest in rank grasps
his Midē´ sack and goes through the gestures, described in connection
with the previous degrees, of shooting into the joints and forehead of
the candidate the sacred mī´gis. At the attempt made by the chief priest
the candidate falls forward apparently unconscious. The priests then
touch his joints and forehead with the upper end of their Midē´ sacks
whereupon he recovers and rises to a standing posture. The chief then
addresses him and enjoins him to conduct himself with propriety and in
accordance with the dignity of his profession. The following is the
text, viz: Gi-gan´-bis-sĭn dau´-gē-in´-ni-nân´ kish-bin´-bish-in

<p>The translation is as follows: “You heed to what I say to you; if you
are listening and will do what is right you will live to have white
hair. That is all; you will do away with all bad actions.”</p>

<p>The Midē´ priest second in rank then says to the candidate:
Ke´-go-wi´-ka-za´-gi-to-wa´-kin ki-da´-no-ka´tshĭ-gân kai-ē´-gi-gīt´
a-sē´-ma, kai´-e-mī´-dzĭm, which signifies: “Never begrudge your goods,
neither your tobacco, nor your provisions.” To this the candidate
responds ē<sup>n</sup>´&mdash;yes, by this signifying that he will never
regret what he has given the Midē´ for their services. The candidate
remains standing while the members of the society take seats, after
which he goes to the pile of blankets, skins, and other presents, and
upon selecting appropriate ones for the officiating priests he carries
them to those persons, after which he makes presents of less value to
all other Midē´ present. Tobacco is then distributed, and while all are
preparing to make an offering to Ki´tshi Man´idō of tobacco, the

DESCRIPTIVE NOTES.</a></h5>

<p>Although the mī´gis shell of the several degrees is generally of the
same species, some of the older Midē´ priests claim that there were
formerly specific shells, each being characteristic and pertaining
specially to each individual grade. The objects claimed by Sika´s-sigĕ
as referring to the third degree are, in addition to the Cypræa monata,
L., a piece of purple wampum, and one shell of elongated form, both
shown on <a href = "#plateXI">Pl. <span class =

<p>The fact of a Midē´ having been subjected to “mī´gis shooting” for
the third time is an all-sufficient reason to the Indian why his powers
are in a corresponding manner augmented. His powers of exorcism and
incantation are greater; his knowledge and use of magic medicines more
extended and certain of effect; and his ability to do harm, as in the
capacity of a Wâbĕnō´, is more and more lauded and feared. He becomes
possessed of a greater power in prophecy and prevision, and in this
state enters the class of personages known as the Jĕs´sakkīd´, or
jugglers. His power over darkness and obscurity is indicated on <a href

<p>The Jĕs´sakkīd´ and his manner of performing have already been
mentioned. This class of sorcerers were met with by the Jesuit Fathers
early in the seventeenth century, and referred to under various
designations, such as jongleur, magicien, consulteur du manitou, etc.
Their influence in the tribe was recognized, and formed one of the
greatest obstacles encountered in the Christianization of the Indians.
Although the Jĕs´sakkīd´ may be a seer and prophet as well as a
practitioner of exorcism without becoming a

member of the Midē´wiwin, it is only when a Midē´ attains the rank of
the third degree that he begins to give evidence of, or pretends to
exhibit with any degree of confidence, the powers accredited to the
former. The structure erected and occupied by the Jĕs´sakkīd´ for the
performance of his powers as prophet or oracle has before been described
as cylindrical, being made by planting four or more poles and wrapping
about them sheets of birch bark, blankets, or similar material that will
serve as a covering. This form of structure is generally represented in
pictographic records, as shown in <a href =

<p>The accompanying illustrations, Figs. 27, 28, and 29, reproduced from
birch-bark etchings, were the property of Jĕs´sakkīd´, who were also
Midē´ of the third and fourth degrees. It will be noticed that the
structure used by them is in the form of the ordinary wig´iwam, as their
profession of medical magic is apparently held in higher esteem than the
art of prophecy; their status and claims as Jĕs´sakkīd´ being indicated
by the great number of ma´nidōs which they have the power of invoking.
These man´idōs, or spirits, are indicated by the outline of their
material forms, the heart being indicated and connected with the
interior of the structure to show the power of the Jĕs´sakkīd´ over the
life of the respective spirits. The Thunder-bird usually occupies the
highest position in his estimation, and for this reason is drawn
directly over the wig´iwam. The Turtle is claimed to be the man´idō who
acts as intermediary between the Jĕs´sakkīd´ and the other man´idōs, and
is therefore not found among the characters on the outside of the
wig´iwam, but his presence is indicated within, either at the spot
marking the convergence of the “life lines,” or immediately below it.

etching made by a Jĕs´sakkīd´ at White Earth, Minnesota. The two curved
lines above the Jĕs´sakkan´ represent the sky, from which magic power is
derived, as shown by the waving line extending downward. The small spots
within the structure are “magic spots,” i.e., the presence of man´idōs.
The juggler is shown upon the left side near the base. When a prophet is
so fortunate as to be able to claim one of these man´idōs as his own
tutelary daimon, his advantage in invoking the others is comparatively
greater. Before proceeding to the Jĕs´sakkân´&mdash;or the “Jugglery,”
as the Jĕs´sakkīd´ wig´iwam is commonly designated, a prophet will
prepare himself by smoking and making an offering to his man´idō, and by
singing a chant, of which an example is presented on <a href =
"#plateXIVd">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XIV</span>,&nbsp;D</a>. It
is a reproduction of one made by a Jĕs´sakkīd´ who was also a Midē´ of

according to the effect which it may be desirable to produce or the
inspired state of the singer.</p>

<p>In addition to the practice of medical magic, the Jĕs´sakkīd´
sometimes resorts to a curious process to extract from the patient’s
body the malevolent beings or man´idōs which cause disease. The method
of procedure is as follows: The Jĕs´sakkīd´ is provided with four or
more tubular bones, consisting of the leg bones of large birds, each of
the thickness of a finger and 4 or 5 inches in length. After the priest
has fasted and chanted prayers for success, he gets down upon all fours
close to the patient and with his mouth near the affected part. After
using the rattle and singing most vociferously to cause the evil man´idō
to take shelter at some particular spot, so that it may be detected and
located by him, he suddenly touches that place with the end of one of
the bones and immediately thereafter putting the other end into his
mouth, as if it were a cigar, strikes it with the flat hand and sends it
apparently down his throat. Then the second bone is treated in the same
manner, as also the third and fourth, the last one being permitted to
protrude from the mouth, when the end is put against the affected part
and sucking is indulged in amid the most violent writhings and
contortions in his endeavors to extract the man´idō. As this object is
supposed to have been reached and swallowed by the Jĕs´sakkīd´ he crawls
away to a short distance from the patient and relieves himself of the
demon with violent
<span class = "pagenum">255</span>
<a name = "page255" id = "page255"> </a>
<!--png 331-->
retchings and apparent suffering. He recovers in a short time, spits out
the bones, and, after directing his patient what further medicine to
swallow, receives his fee and departs. Further description of this
practice will be referred to below and illustrated on <a href =
"#plateXVIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XVIII</span></a>.</p>

<p>The above manner of disposing of the hollow bones is a clever trick
and not readily detected, and it is only by such acts of jugglery and
other delusions that he maintains his influence and importance among the
credulous.</p>

<p>The Midē´wigân, in which this degree is conferred, differs from the
preceding structures by having open doorways in both the northern and
southern walls, about midway between the eastern and western extremities
and opposite to one another. <a href = "#fig33">Fig.&nbsp;33</a>
represents a ground plan, in which may also be observed the location of
each of the four Midē´ posts. <a href = "#fig34">Fig.&nbsp;34</a> shows

entrance is deposited the sacred stone, beyond which is an area reserved
for the presents to be deposited by an applicant for initiation. The
remaining two-thirds of the space toward the western door is occupied at
regular intervals by four posts, the first being painted red with a band
of green around the top. (<a href = "#plateXV">Pl. <span class =

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;General view of
Midē´wigân.</p>

<p>About 10 paces east of the main entrance, in a direct line between it
and the sweat lodge, is planted a piece of thin board 3 feet high and 6
inches broad, the top of which is cut so as to present a three-lobed
apex, as shown in <a href = "#fig4"><ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Fig. 3’">Fig. 4</ins></a>. The eastern side of this board
is painted green; that facing the Midē´wigân red. Near the top is a
small opening, through which the Midē´ are enabled to peep into the
interior of the sacred structure to observe the angry man´idōs occupying
the structure and opposing the intrusion of anyone not of the fourth
degree.</p>

<p>A cedar tree is planted at each of the outer corners of the
Midē´wigân, and about 6 paces away from the northern, western, and
southern entrances a small brush structure is erected, sufficiently
large to admit the body. These structures are termed bears´ nests,
supposed to be points where the Bear Man´idō rested during the struggle
he passed through while fighting with the malevolent man´idōs within to
gain entrance and receive the fourth-degree initiation. Immediately
within and to either side of the east and west entrances is planted a
short post, 5 feet high and 8 inches thick, painted red upon the side
facing the interior and black upon the reverse, at the base of each
being laid a stone about as large as a human head. These four posts
represent the four limbs and feet of the Bear Man´idō, who made the four
entrances and forcibly entered and expelled the evil beings who had
opposed him. The fourth-degree Midē´ post&mdash;

PREPARATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances it requires at least one year before a
Midē´ of the third grade is considered eligible for promotion, and it is
seldom that a candidate can procure the necessary presents within that
period, so that frequently a number of years elapse before any
intimation by a candidate is made to the chief priest that the necessary
requirements can be complied with. The chief reason of this delay is
attributed to the fact that the fee to the officiating priests alone
must equal in value and quantity four times the amount paid at the first
initiation, and as the success in gathering the robes, skins, blankets,
etc., depends upon the candidate’s own exertions it will readily appear
why so few ever attain the distinction sought. Should one be so
fortunate, however, as to possess the required articles, he has only to
make known the fact to the chief and assistant Midē´ priests, when a
meeting is held at the wig´iwam of one of the members and the merits of
the candidate discussed. For this purpose tobacco is furnished by the
candidate. The more valuable and more numerous the presents the more
rapidly will his application be disposed of, and the more certainly will
favorable consideration on it be had. It becomes necessary, as in former
instances of preparation, for the candidate to procure the service of a
renowned Midē´, in order to acquire new or specially celebrated remedies
or charms. The candidate may also give evidence of his own proficiency
in magic without revealing the secrets of his success or the course
pursued to attain it. The greater the mystery the higher he is held in
esteem even by his jealous confrères.</p>

<p>There is not much to be gained by preparatory instruction for the
fourth degree, the chief claims being a renewal of the ceremony of
“shooting the mī´gis” into the body of the candidate, and enacting or
dramatizing the traditional efforts of the Bear Man´idō in his endeavor
to receive from the Otter the secrets of this grade. One who succeeds
becomes correspondingly powerful in his profession and therefore more
feared by the credulous. His sources of income are accordingly increased
by the greater number of Indians who require his assistance. Hunters,
warriors, and lovers have occasion to call upon him, and sometimes
antidoting charms are sought, when the evil effects of an enemy’s work
are to be counteracted.</p>

<p>The instructor receives the visit of the candidate, and upon coming
to a satisfactory agreement concerning the fee to be paid for the
service he prepares his pupil by prompting him as to the part he is to
enact during the initiation and the reasons therefor. The preparation
and the merits of magic compounds are discussed, and
<span class = "pagenum">258</span>
<a name = "page258" id = "page258"> </a>
<!--png 334-->
the pupil receives instruction in making effective charms, compounding
love powder, etc. This love powder is held in high esteem, and its
composition is held a profound secret, to be transmitted only when a
great fee is paid. It consists of the following ingredients: Vermilion;
powdered snakeroot (Polygala senega,&nbsp;L.); exiguam particulam
sanguinis a puella effusi, quum in primis menstruis esset; and a piece
of ginseng cut from the bifurcation of the root, and powdered. These are
mixed and put into a small buckskin bag. The preparation is undertaken
only after an offering to Ki´tshi Man´idō of tobacco and a Midē´ song
with rattle accompaniment. The manner of using this powder will be
described under the caption of “descriptive notes.” It differs entirely
from the powder employed in painting the face by one who wishes to
attract or fascinate the object of his or her devotion. The latter is
referred to by the Rev. Peter Jones<a class = "tag" href = "#note16"
name = "tag16" id = "tag16">16</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>There is a particular kind of charm which they use when they
wish to obtain the object of their affections. It is made of roots and
red ocher. With this they paint their faces, believing it to possess a
power so irresistible as to cause the object of their desire to love
them. But the moment this medicine is taken away and the charm withdrawn
the person who before was almost frantic with love hates with a perfect
hatred.</blockquote>

<p>It is necessary that the candidate take a sweat-bath once each day,
for four successive days, at some time during the autumn months of the
year preceding the year in which the initiation is to occur. This form
of preparation is deemed agreeable to Ki´tshi Man´idō, whose favor is
constantly invoked that the candidate may be favored with the powers
supposed to be conferred in the last degree. As spring approaches the
candidate makes occasional presents of tobacco to the chief priest and
his assistants, and when the period of the annual ceremony approaches,
they send out runners to members to solicit their presence, and, if of
the fourth degree, their assistance.</p>

INITIATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>The candidate removes to the vicinity of the Midē´wigân so as to be
able to go through the ceremony of purgation four times before the day
of initiation. The sudatory having been constructed on the usual site,
east of the large structure, he enters it on the morning of the fifth
day preceding the initiation and after taking a sweat-bath he is joined
by the preceptor, when both proceed to the four entrances of the
Midē´wigân and deposit at each a small offering of tobacco. This
procedure is followed on the second and third days, also, but upon the
fourth the presents are also carried along and deposited at the
entrances, where they are received by assistants and suspended from the
rafters of the interior. On the evening of the last day, the chief and
officiating priests visit the candidate and his preceptor,
<span class = "pagenum">259</span>
<a name = "page259" id = "page259"> </a>
<!--png 335-->
in the sweat-lodge, when ceremonial smoking is indulged in followed by
the recitation of Midē´ chants. The following (<a href =
"#plateXVIa">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XVI</span>,&nbsp;A</a>) is a
reproduction of the chant taught to and recited by the candidate. The
original was obtained from an old mnemonic chart in use at Mille Lacs,
Minnesota, in the year 1825, which in turn had been copied from a record
in the possession of a Midē´ priest at La Pointe, Wisconsin. Many of the
words are of an older form than those in use at the present day. Each
line may be repeated ad libitum.</p>

<p>Upon the conclusion of the chant, the assembled Midē´ smoke and
review the manner of procedure for the morrow’s ceremony, and when these
details have been settled they disperse, to return to their wig´iwams,
or to visit Midē´ who may have come from distant settlements.</p>

<p>Early on the day of his initiation the candidate returns to the
sudatory to await the coming of his preceptor. The gifts of tobacco are
divided into parcels which may thus be easily distributed at the proper
time, and as soon as the officiating priests have arrived, and seated
themselves, the candidate produces some tobacco of which all present
take a pipeful, when a ceremonial smoke-offering is made to Ki´tshi
Man´idō. The candidate then takes his midē´ drum and sings a song of his
own composition, or one which he may have purchased from his preceptor,
or some Midē´ priest. The following is a reproduction of an old mnemonic
song which the owner, Sikas´sigĕ, had received from his father who in
turn had obtained it at La Pointe, Wisconsin, about the year 1800. The
words are archaic to a great extent, and they furthermore differ from
the modern language on account of the manner in which they are
pronounced in chanting, which peculiarity has been faithfully followed
below. The pictographic characters are reproduced in <a href =

<p>Upon the completion of this preliminary by the candidate, the priests
emerge from the wig´iwam and fall in line according to their official
status, when the candidate and preceptor gather up the parcels of
tobacco and place themselves at the head of the column and start toward
the eastern entrance of the Midē´wigân. As they approach the lone post,
or board, the candidate halts, when the priests continue to chant and
drum upon the Midē´ drum. The chief Midē´ then advances to the board and
peeps through the orifice near the top to view malevolent man´idōs
occupying the interior, who are antagonistic to the entrance of a
stranger. This spot is assumed to represent the resting place or “nest,”
from which the Bear Man´idō viewed the evil spirits during the time of
his initiation by the Otter. The evil spirits within are crouching upon
the floor, one behind the other and facing the east, the first being
Mi-shi´-bi-shi´&mdash;the panther; the second, Me-shi´-kĕ&mdash;the
turtle; the third, kwin´-go-â´-gĭ&mdash;the big wolverine; the fourth,
wâ´-gŭsh&mdash;the fox; the fifth, ma-in´-gŭn&mdash;the wolf; and the
sixth, ma-kwa´&mdash;the bear. They are the ones who endeavor to
counteract or destroy the good wrought by the rites of the Midē´wiwin,
and only by the aid of the good man´idōs can they be driven from the
Midē´wigân so as to permit a candidate to enter and receive the benefits
of the degree. The second Midē´ then views the group of malevolent
beings, after which the third, and lastly the fourth priest looks
through the orifice. They then advise
<span class = "pagenum">262</span>
<a name = "page262" id = "page262"> </a>
<!--png 338-->
the presentation by the candidate of tobacco at that point to invoke the
best efforts of the Midē´ Man´idōs in his behalf.</p>

<p>It is asserted that all of the malevolent man´idōs who occupied and
surrounded the preceding degree structures have now assembled about this
fourth degree of the Midē´wigân to make a final effort against the
admission and advancement of the candidate: therefore he impersonates
the good Bear Man´idō, and is obliged to follow a similar course in
approaching from his present position the entrance of the structure.
Upon hands and knees he slowly crawls toward the main entrance, when a
wailing voice is heard in the east which sounds like the word
hā<sup>n</sup>´, prolonged in a monotone. This is
ge´-gi-si´-bi-ga´-ne-dât man´idō. His bones are heard rattling as he
approaches; he wields his bow and arrow; his long hair streaming in the
air, and his body, covered with mī´gis shells from the salt sea, from
which he has emerged to aid in the expulsion of the opposing spirits.
This being the information given to the candidate he assumes and
personates the character of the man´idō referred to, and being given a
bow and four arrows, and under the guidance of his preceptor, he
proceeds toward the main entrance of the structure while the officiating
priests enter and station themselves within the door facing the west.
The preceptor carries the remaining parcels of tobacco, and when the
candidate arrives near the door he makes four movements with his bow and
arrow toward the interior, as if shooting, the last time sending an
arrow within, upon which the grinning spirits are forced to retreat
toward the other end of the inclosure. The candidate then rushes in at
the main entrance, and upon emerging at the south suddenly turns and
again employs his bow and arrow four times toward the crowd of evil
man´idōs, who have rushed toward him during the interval that he was
within. At the last gesture of shooting into the inclosure, he sends
forward an arrow, deposits a parcel of tobacco and crouches to rest at
the so-called “bear’s nest.” During this period of repose the Midē´
priests continue to drum and sing. Then the candidate approaches the
southern door again, on all fours, and the moment he arrives there he
rises and is hurried through the inclosure to emerge at the west, where
he turns suddenly, and imitating the manner of shooting arrows into the
group of angry man´idōs within, he at the fourth movement lets fly an
arrow and gets down into the western “bear’s nest.” After a short
interval he again approaches the door, crawling forward on his hands and
knees until he reaches the entrance, where he leaves a present of
tobacco and is hastened through the inclosure to emerge at the northern
door, where he again turns suddenly upon the angry spirits, and after
making threatening movements toward them, at the fourth menace he sends
an arrow among them. The spirits are now greatly annoyed by the magic
power possessed by the candidate and the assistance rendered by the
Midē´

Man´idōs, so that they are compelled to seek safety in flight. The
candidate is resting in the northern “bear’s nest,” and as he again
crawls toward the Midē´wigân, on hands and knees, he deposits another
gift of a parcel of tobacco, then rises and is hurried through the
interior to emerge at the entrance door, where he turns around, and
seeing but a few angry man´idōs remaining, he takes his last arrow and
aiming it at them makes four threatening gestures toward them, at the
last sending the arrow into the structure, which puts to flight all
opposition on the part of this host of man´idōs. The path is now clear,
and after he deposits another gift of tobacco at the door he is led
within, and the preceptor receives the bow and deposits it with the
remaining tobacco upon the pile of blankets and robes that have by this
time been removed from the rafters and laid upon the ground midway
between the sacred Midē´ stone and the first Midē´ post.</p>

<p>The chief Midē´ priest then takes charge of the candidate,
saying:</p>

<p>To this the second Midē´ priest remarks to the candidate,
Wa´-shi-gân´-do-we-an´ mi-gai´-i-nŏk´ wa´-ka-no´-shi-dzin&mdash;which
freely translated signifies: “The reason I now advise you is that you
may heed him when he speaks to you.” The candidate is then led around
the interior of the inclosure, the assistant Midē´ fall in line of march
and are followed by all the others present, excepting the musicians.
During the circuit, which is performed slowly, the chief Midē´ drums
upon the Midē´ drum and chants. The following, reproduced from the
original, on <a href = "#plateXVIIb">Pl. <span class =

words, some of which are furthermore different from the spoken language
on account of their being chanted, and meaningless syllables introduced
to prolong certain accentuated notes. Each line and stanza may be
repeated ad libitum.</p>

<p>By the time this chant is completed the head of the procession
reaches the point of departure, just within the eastern door, and all of
the members return to their seats, only the four officiating Midē´
remaining with the candidate and his preceptor. To search further
<span class = "pagenum">265</span>

that no malevolent man´idōs may remain lurking within the Midē´wigân,
the chief priests lead the candidate in a zigzag manner to the western
door, and back again to the east. In this way the path leads past the
side of the Midē´ stone, then right oblique to the north of the heap of
presents, thence left oblique to the south of the first-degree post,
then passing the second on the north, and so on until the last post is
reached, around which the course continues, and back in a similar
serpentine manner to the eastern door. The candidate is then led to the
blankets, upon which he seats himself, the four officiating priests
placing themselves before him, the preceptor standing back near the
first of the four degree posts.</p>

<p>The Midē´ priest of the fourth rank or place in order of precedence
approaches the kneeling candidate and in a manner similar to that which
has already been described shoots into his breast the mī´gis; the third,
second and first Midē´ follow in like manner, the last named alone
shooting his mī´gis into the candidate’s forehead, upon which he falls
forward, spits out a mī´gis shell which he had previously secreted in
his mouth, and upon the priests rubbing upon his back and limbs their
Midē´ sacks he recovers and resumes his sitting posture.</p>

<p>The officiating priests retire to either side of the inclosure to
find seats, when the newly received member arises and with the
assistance of the preceptor distributes the remaining parcels of
tobacco, and lastly the blankets, robes, and other gifts. He then begins
at the southeastern angle of the inclosure to return thanks for
admission, places both hands upon the first person, and as he moves them
downward over his hair says: Mi-gwĕtsh´ ga-o´-shi-tō´-ĭn
bi-mâ´-dĭ-sĭ-win&mdash;“Thanks, for giving to me life.” The Midē´
addressed bows his head and responds, hau´, ē<sup>n</sup>´,&mdash;yes
when the newly admitted member steps back one pace, clasps his hands and
inclines his head to the front. This movement is continued until all
present have been thanked, after which he takes a seat in the
southeastern corner of the inclosure.</p>

<p>A curious ceremony then takes place in which all the Midē´ on one
side of the inclosure arise and approach those upon the other, each
grasping his Midē´ sack and selecting a victim pretends to shoot into
his body the mī´gis, whereupon the Midē´ so shot falls over, and after a
brief attack of gagging and retching pretends to gain relief by spitting
out of his mouth a mī´gis shell. This is held upon the left palm, and as
the opposing party retreat to their seats, the side which has just been
subjected to the attack moves rapidly around among one another as if
dancing, but simply giving rapid utterance to the word hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,
hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, and showing the mī´gis to everybody present, after which
they place the flat hands quickly to the mouth and pretend again to
swallow their respective shells. The members of this party then
similarly attack their opponents, who
<span class = "pagenum">266</span>
<a name = "page266" id = "page266"> </a>
<!--png 342-->
submit to similar treatment and go through like movements in exhibiting
the mī´gis, which they again swallow. When quiet has been restored, and
after a ceremonial smoke has been indulged in, the candidate sings, or
chants, the production being either his own composition or that of some
other person from whom it has been purchased. The chant presented
herewith was obtained from Sikas´sigĕ, who had received it in turn from
his father when the latter was chief priest of the Midē´wiwin at Mille
Lacs, Minnesota. The pictographic characters are reproduced on <a href =

<p>The following musical notation presents accurately the range of notes
employed by the preceptor. The peculiarity of Midē´ songs lies in the
fact that each person has his own individual series of notes which
correspond to the number of syllables in the phrase and add thereto
meaningless words to prolong the effect. When a song is taught, the
words are the chief and most important part, the musical rendering of a
second person may be so different from that of the person from whom he
learns it as to be unrecognizable without
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<a name = "page274" id = "page274"> </a>
<!--png 352-->
the words. Another fact which often presents itself is the absence of
time and measure, which prevents any reduction to notation by full bars;
e.g., one or two bars may appear to consist of four quarter notes or a
sufficient number of quarters and eighths to complete such bars, but the
succeeding one may consist of an additional quarter, or perhaps two,
thus destroying all semblance of rythmic continuity. This peculiarity is
not so common in dancing music, in which the instruments of percussion
are employed to assist regularity and to accord with the steps made by
the dancers, or vice versa.</p>

<p>In some of the songs presented in this paper the bars have been
omitted for the reasons presented above. The peculiarity of the songs as
rendered by the preceptor is thus more plainly indicated.</p>

<p>When the chant is ended the ushers, who are appointed by the chief
Midē´, leave the inclosure to bring in the vessels of food. This is
furnished by the newly elected member and is prepared by his female
relatives and friends. The kettles and dishes of food are borne around
four times, so that each one present may have the opportunity of eating
sufficiently. Smoking and conversation relating to the Midē´wiwin may
then be continued until toward sunset, when, upon an intimation from the
chief Midē´, the members quietly retire, leaving the structure by the
western door. All personal property is removed, and upon the following
day everybody departs.</p>

DESCRIPTIVE NOTES.</a></h5>

<p>The amount of influence wielded by Midē´ generally, and particularly
such as have received four degrees, is beyond belief. The rite of the
Midē´wiwin is deemed equivalent to a religion&mdash;as that term is
commonly understood by intelligent people&mdash;and is believed to
elevate such a Midē´ to the nearest possible approach to the reputed
character of Mi´nabō´zho, and to place within his reach the supernatural
power of invoking and communing with Ki´tshi Man´idō himself.</p>

<p>By reference to <a href = "#plateIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">III</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, No. 98, it will be observed that
the human figure is specially marked with very pronounced indications of
mī´gis spots upon the head, the extremities, and more particularly the
breast. These are placed where the mīgis was “shot” into the Midē´, and
the functions of the several parts are therefore believed to be greatly
augmented. All the spots are united by a line to denote unity and
harmony of action in the exercise of power.</p>

<p>The mī´gis, typical of the fourth degree, consists of small pieces of
deer horn, covered with red paint on one end and green upon the other.
Sometimes but one color is employed for the entire object. The form is
shown on <a href = "#plateXI">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XI</span></a>, No. 6. No. 2, upon the same plate,
represents a shell, used as a mī´gis, observed at White Earth.</p>

<p>Figs. 5-11, on <a href = "#plateXV">Pl. <span class =

posts, as practiced by the several societies in Minnesota. Each society
claims to preserve the ancient method. The cross, shown in No. 7, bears
the typical colors&mdash;red and green&mdash;upon the upper half, while
the lower post is square and colored white on the east, green on the
south, red on the west, and black on the north. The Midē´ explain the
signification of the colors as follows: White represents the east, the
source of light and the direction from which the sacred mī´gis came;
green, sha´manō the southern one, refers to the source of the rains, the
direction from which the Thunderers come in the spring, they who
revivify the earth; red refers to the land of the setting sun, the abode
of the shadows or the dead; and north being black, because that is the
direction from which come cold, hunger, and disease.</p>

<p>The words of the Midē´ priest alluding to “the path that has no end”
refer to the future course and conduct of the candidate for the last
degree, as well as to the possibility of attaining unlimited powers in
magic, and is pictorially designated upon the chart on <a href =
"#plateIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">III</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, at
No. 99. The path is devious and beset with temptations, but by strict
adherence to the principles of the Midē´wiwin the Midē´ may reach the
goal and become the superior of his confrères, designated
Mi-ni´-si-nō´-shkwe, “he who lives on the island.”</p>

<p>A Midē´-Wâbĕnō´ of this degree is dreaded on account of his
extraordinary power of inflicting injury, causing misfortune, etc., and
most remarkable tales are extant concerning his astounding performances
with fire.</p>

<p>The following performance is said to have occurred at White Earth,
Minnesota, in the presence of a large gathering of Indians and mixed
bloods. Two small wig´iwams were erected, about 50 paces from each
other, and after the Wâbĕnō´ had crawled into one of them his
disparagers built around each of them a continuous heap of brush and
firewood, which were then kindled. When the blaze was at its height all
became hushed for a moment, and presently the Wâbĕnō´ called to the
crowd that he had transferred himself to the other wig´iwam and
immediately, to their profound astonishment, crawled forth unharmed.</p>

<p>This is but an example of the numerous and marvelous abilities with
which the Wâbĕnō´ of the higher grade is accredited.</p>

<p>The special pretensions claimed by the Midē-Wâbĕnō´ have already been
mentioned, but an account of the properties and manner of using the
“love powder” may here be appropriate. This powder&mdash;the composition
of which has been given&mdash;is generally used by the owner to
accomplish results desired by the applicant. It is carried in a small
bag made of buckskin or cloth, which the Wâbĕnō´ carefully deposits
within his Midē´ sack, but which is transferred to another sack of like
size and loaned to the applicant, for a valuable consideration.</p>

During a recent visit to one of the reservations in Minnesota, I had
occasion to confer with a Catholic missionary regarding some of the
peculiar medical practices of the Indians, and the implements and other
accessories employed in connection with their profession. He related the
following incident as having but a short time previously come under his
own personal observation:</p>

<p>One of the members of his church, a Norwegian, sixty-two years of
age, and a widower, had for the last preceding year been considered by
most of the residents as demented. The missionary himself had observed
his erratic and frequently irrational conduct, and was impressed with
the probable truth of the prevailing rumor. One morning, however, as the
missionary was seated in his study, he was surprised to receive a very
early call, and upon invitation his visitor took a seat and explained
the object of his visit. He said that for the last year he had been so
disturbed in his peace of mind that he now came to seek advice. He was
fully aware of the common report respecting his conduct, but was utterly
unable to control himself, and attributed the cause of his unfortunate
condition to an occurrence of the year before. Upon waking one morning
his thoughts were unwillingly concentrated upon an Indian woman with
whom he had no personal acquaintance whatever, and, notwithstanding the
absurdity of the impression, he was unable to cast it aside. After
breakfast he was, by some inexplicable influence, compelled to call upon
her, and to introduce himself, and although he expected to be able to
avoid repeating the visit, he never had sufficient control over himself
to resist lurking in the vicinity of her habitation.</p>

<p>Upon his return home after the first visit he discovered lying upon
the floor under his bed, a Midē´ sack which contained some small parcels
with which he was unfamiliar, but was afterward told that one of them
consisted of “love powder.” He stated that he had grown children, and
the idea of marrying again was out of the question, not only on their
account but because he was now too old. The missionary reasoned with him
and suggested a course of procedure, the result of which had not been
learned when the incident was related.</p>

<p>Jugglery of another kind, to which allusion has before been made, is
also attributed to the highest class of Jĕs´sakkīd´. Several years ago
the following account was related to Col. Garrick Mallery, U.S. Army,
and myself, and as Col. Mallery subsequently read a paper before the
Anthropological Society of Washington, District of Columbia, in which
the account was mentioned, I quote his words:</p>

<blockquote>Paul Beaulieu, an Ojibwa of mixed blood, present interpreter
at White Earth Agency, Minnesota, gave me his experience with a
Jĕs´sakkīd´, at Leech Lake, Minnesota, about the year 1858. The reports
of his wonderful performances had reached the agency, and as Beaulieu
had no faith in jugglers, he offered to wager
<span class = "pagenum">277</span>
<a name = "page277" id = "page277"> </a>
<!--png 355-->
$100, a large sum, then and there, against goods of equal value, that
the juggler could not perform satisfactorily one of the tricks of his
repertoire to be selected by him (Beaulieu) in the presence of himself
and a committee of his friends. The Jĕs´sakkân´&mdash;or Jĕs´sakkīd´
lodge&mdash;was then erected. The framework of vertical poles, inclined
to the center, was filled in with interlaced twigs covered with blankets
and birch-bark from the ground to the top, leaving an upper orifice of
about a foot in diameter for the ingress and egress of spirits and the
objects to be mentioned, but not large enough for the passage of a man’s
body. At one side of the lower wrapping a flap was left for the entrance
of the Jĕs´sakkīd´.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A committee of twelve was selected to see that no
communication was possible between the Jĕs´sakkīd´ and confederates.
These were reliable people, one of them the Episcopal clergyman of the
reservation. The spectators were several hundred in number, but they
stood off, not being allowed to approach.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Jĕs´sakkīd´ then removed his clothing, until nothing
remained but the breech-cloth. Beaulieu took a rope (selected by himself
for the purpose) and first tied and knotted one end about the juggler’s
ankles; his knees were then securely tied together, next the wrists,
after which the arms were passed over the knees and a billet of wood
passed through under the knees, thus securing and keeping the arms down
motionless. The rope was then passed around the neck, again and again,
each time tied and knotted, so as to bring the face down upon the knees.
A flat river-stone, of black color&mdash;which was the Jĕs´sakkīd´’s
ma´nidō or amulet&mdash;was left lying upon his thighs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Jĕs´sakkīd´ was then carried to the lodge and placed
inside upon a mat on the ground, and the flap covering was restored so
as to completely hide him from view.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Immediately loud, thumping noises were heard, and the
framework began to sway from side to side with great violence; whereupon
the clergyman remarked that this was the work of the Evil One and ‘it
was no place for him,’ so he left and did not see the end. After a few
minutes of violent movements and swayings of the lodge accompanied by
loud inarticulate noises, the motions gradually ceased when the voice of
the juggler was heard, telling Beaulieu to go to the house of a friend,
near by, and get the rope. Now, Beaulieu, suspecting some joke was to be
played upon him, directed the committee to be very careful not to permit
any one to approach while he went for the rope, which he found at the
place indicated, still tied exactly as he had placed it about the neck
and extremities of the Jĕs´sakkīd´. He immediately returned, laid it
down before the spectators, and requested of the Jĕs´sakkīd´ to be
allowed to look at him, which was granted, but with the understanding
that Beaulieu was not to touch him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the covering was pulled aside, the Jĕs´sakkīd´ sat
within the lodge, contentedly smoking his pipe, with no other object in
sight than the black stone mánidō. Beaulieu paid his wager of
$100.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An exhibition of similar pretended powers, also for a wager,
was announced a short time after, at Yellow Medicine, Minnesota, to be
given in the presence of a number of Army people, but at the threat of
the Grand Medicine Man of the Leech Lake bands, who probably objected to
interference with his lucrative monopoly, the event did not take place
and bets were declared off.</blockquote>

<p>Col. Mallery obtained further information, of a similar kind from
various persons on the Bad River Reservation, and at Bayfield,
Wisconsin. All of these he considered to be mere variants of a class of
performances which were reported by the colonists of New England and the
first French missionaries in Canada as early as 1613, where the general
designation of “The Sorcerers” was applied to the whole body of Indians
on the Ottawa River. These reports, it must be

remembered, however, applied only to the numerous tribes of the
Algonkian linguistic family among which the alleged practices existed;
though neighboring tribes of other linguistic groups were no doubt
familiar with them, just as the Winnebago, Omaha, and other allied
tribes, profess to have “Medicine Societies,” the secrets of which they
claim to have obtained from tribes located east of their own habitat,
that practiced the peculiar ceremony of “shooting small shells” (i.e.,
the mī´gis of the Ojibwa) into the candidate.</p>

DZHIBAI´ MIDĒ´WIGÂN, OR “GHOST LODGE.”</a></h4>

<p>A structure erected by Indians for any purpose whatever, is now
generally designated a lodge, in which sense the term is applied in
connection with the word dzhibai´&mdash;ghost, or more appropriately
shadow&mdash;in the above caption. This lodge is constructed in a form
similar to that of the Midē´wigân, but its greatest diameter extends
north and south instead of east and west. Further reference will be made
to this in describing another method of conferring the initiation of the
first degree of the Midē´wiwin. This distinction is attained by first
becoming a member of the so-called “Ghost Society,” in the manner and
for the reason following:</p>

<p>After the birth of a male child it is customary to invite the friends
of the family to a feast, designating at the same time a Midē´ to serve
as godfather and to dedicate the child to some special pursuit in life.
The Midē´ is governed in his decision by visions, and it thus sometimes
happens that the child is dedicated to the “Grand Medicine,” i.e., he is
to be prepared to enter the society of the Midē´. In such a case the
parents prepare him by procuring a good preceptor, and gather together
robes, blankets, and other gifts to be presented at initiation.</p>

<p>Should this son die before the age of puberty, before which period it
is not customary to admit any one into the society, the father paints
his own face as before described, viz, red, with a green stripe
diagonally across the face from left to right, as in <a href =
"#plateVI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">VI</span></a>, No. 4, or red
with two short horizontal parallel bars in green upon the forehead as in
<a href = "#plateVI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">VI</span></a>, No.
5, and announces to the chief Midē´ priest his intention of becoming
himself a member of the “Ghost Society” and his readiness to receive the
first degree of the Midē´wiwin, as a substitute for his deceased son.
Other members of the mourner’s family blacken the face, as shown on <a
href = "#plateVII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">VII</span></a>,
No.&nbsp;5.</p>

<p>In due time a council of Midē´ priests is called, who visit the
wig´iwam of the mourner, where they partake of a feast, and the subject
of initiation is discussed. This wig´iwam is situated south and east

<p>The following is an explanation of the several characters:</p>

<p class = "hanging">
No. 1 represents the wig´iwam of the mourner, which has been erected in
the vicinity of the Midē´wigân, until after the ceremony of
initiation.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
No. 2 is the path supposed to be taken by the shadow (spirit) of the
deceased; it leads westward to the Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân; literally,
shadow-spirit wig´iwam.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
No. 3, 4, 5, and 6, designate the places where the spirit plucks the
fruits referred to&mdash;respectively the strawberry, the blueberry, the
June cherries, and the plum.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
No. 7 designates the form and location of the Dzhihai´ Midē´wigân. The
central spot is the place of the dish of food for Dzhibai´
Man´idō&mdash;the good spirit&mdash;and the smaller spots around the
interior of the inclosure are places for the deposit of dishes for the
other Midē´ spirits who have left this earth.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
No. 8 is the path which is taken by the candidate when going from his
wig´iwam to the Midē´wigân.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
No. 9 indicates the place of the sweat-lodge, resorted to at other
periods of initiation.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
No. 10 is the Midē´wigân in which the ceremony is conducted at the
proper time.</p>

<p>It is stated that in former times the Ghost Lodge was erected west of
the location of the mourner’s wig´iwam, but for a long time this
practice has been discontinued. The tradition relating to the Spirit’s
progress is communicated orally, while the dramatic representation is
confined to placing the dishes of food in the Midē´wigân, which is
selected as a fitting and appropriate substitute during the night
preceding the initiation.</p>

<p>This custom, as it was practiced, consisted of carrying from the
mourner’s wig´iwam to the Ghost Lodge the dishes of food for the spirits
of departed Midē´ to enjoy a feast, during the time that the Midē´
priests were partaking of one. A large dish was placed in the center of
the structure by the mourner, from which the supreme Midē´ spirit was to
eat. Dishes are now carried to the Midē´wigân, as stated above.</p>

<p>The chief officiating Midē´ then instructs the father of the deceased
boy the manner in which he is to dress and proceed, as symbolizing the
course pursued by the spirit of the son on the way to the spirit
<span class = "pagenum">280</span>

world. The instructions are carried out, as far as possible, with the
exception of going to an imaginary Ghost Lodge, as he proceeds only to
the Midē´wigân and deposits the articles enumerated below. He is told to
take one pair of bear-skin moccasins, one pair of wolf-skin, and one
pair of birds´ skins, in addition to those which he wears upon his feet;
these are to be carried to the structure in which the Midē´ spirits are
feasting, walking barefooted, picking a strawberry from a plant on the
right of the path and a blueberry from a bush on the left, plucking June
cherries from a tree on the right and plums on the left. He is then to
hasten toward the Ghost Lodge, which is covered with mī´gis, and to
deposit the fruit and the moccasins; these will be used by his son’s
spirit in traveling the road of the dead after the spirits have
completed their feast and reception of him. While the candidate is on
his mission to the Ghost Lodge (for the time being represented by the
Midē´wigân) the assemblage in the wig´iwam chant the following for the
mourner: Yan´-i-ma-tsha´, yan´-i-ma-tsha´, ha´, yan´-i-ma-tsha´
yan´-i-ma-tsha´ ha´, yu´-te-no-win´ gē´, hē´ nin-de´-so-ne´&mdash;“I am
going away, I am going away, I am going away, to the village I
walk”&mdash;i.e., the village of the dead.</p>

<p>The person who desires to receive initiation into the Midē´wigân,
under such circumstances, impersonates Minabō´zho, as he is believed to
have penetrated the country of the abode of shadows, or
ne´-ba-gī´-zis&mdash;“land of the sleeping sun.” He, it is said, did
this to destroy the “Ghost Gambler” and to liberate the many victims who
had fallen into his power. To be enabled to traverse this dark and
dismal path, he borrowed of Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´&mdash;the owl&mdash;his eyes,
and received also the services of wē´-we-tē´-si-wŭg&mdash;the firefly,
both of which were sent back to the earth upon the completion of his
journey. By referring to <a href = "#plateIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">III</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, the reference to this myth will be
observed as pictorially represented in Nos. 110 to 114. No. 110 is the
Midē´wigân from which the traveler has to visit the Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân
(No. 112) in the west. No. 113, represented as Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´&mdash;the
owl&mdash;whose eyes enabled Mī´nabō´zho to follow the path of the dead
(No. 114); the owl skin Midē´ sack is also sometimes used by Midē´
priests who have received their first degree in this wise. The V-shaped
characters within the circle at No. 111 denote the presence of spirits
at the Ghost Lodge, to which reference has been made.</p>

<p>The presents which had been gathered as a gift or fee for the
deceased are now produced and placed in order for transportation to the
Midē´wigân, early on the following morning.</p>

<p>The Midē´ priests then depart, but on the next morning several of
them make their appearance to assist in clearing the Midē´wigân of the
dishes which had been left there over night, and to carry thither the
robes, blankets, and other presents, and suspend them from the rafters.
Upon their return to the candidate’s wig´iwam, the Midē´ priests gather,
and after the candidate starts to lead the procession
<span class = "pagenum">281</span>
<a name = "page281" id = "page281"> </a>
<!--png 361-->
toward the Midē´wigân, the priests fall in in single file, and all move
forward, the Midē´ priests chanting the following words repeatedly, viz:
Ki-e´-ne-kwo-tâ´ ki-e´-ne-kwo-tâ´, ha´, ha´, ha´, nōs e´wi-e´, hē´,
ki´-na-ka´-ta-mŭn´ do-nâ´-gan&mdash;“I also, I also, my father, leave
you my dish.”</p>

<p>This is sung for the deceased, who is supposed to bequeath to his
father his dish, or other articles the names of which are sometimes
added.</p>

<p>The procession continues toward and into the Midē´wigân, passing
around the interior by the left side toward the west, north, and east to
a point opposite the space usually reserved for the deposit of goods,
where the candidate turns to the right and stands in the middle of the
inclosure, where he now faces the Midē´ post in the west. The members
who had not joined the procession, but who had been awaiting its
arrival, now resume their seats, and those who accompanied the candidate
also locate themselves as they desire, when the officiating priests
begin the ceremony as described in connection with the initiation for
the first degree after the candidate has been turned over to the chief
by the preceptor.</p>

<p>Sometimes the mother of one who had been so dedicated to the
Midē´wiwin is taken into that society, particularly when the father is
absent or dead.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "subst" id = "subst">
INITIATION BY SUBSTITUTION.</a></h5>

<p>It sometimes happens that a sick person can not be successfully
treated by the Midē´, especially in the wig´iwam of the patient, when it
becomes necessary for the latter to be carried to the Midē´wigân and the
services of the society to be held. This course is particularly followed
when the sick person or the family can furnish a fee equivalent to the
gift required for initiation under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>It is believed, under such conditions, that the evil man´idōs can be
expelled from the body only in the sacred structure, at which place
alone the presence of Ki´tshi Man´idō may be felt, after invocation, and
in return for his aid in prolonging the life of the patient the latter
promises his future existence to be devoted to the practice and
teachings of the Midē´wiwin. Before proceeding further, however, it is
necessary to describe the method pursued by the Midē´ priest.</p>

<p>The first administrations may consist of mashki´kiwabū<sup>n</sup>´,
or medicine broth, this being the prescription of the Midē´ in the
capacity of mashki´kike´winĭ´nĭ, or herbalist, during which medication
he resorts to incantation and exorcism, accompanying his song by liberal
use of the rattle. As an illustration of the songs used at this period
of the illness, the following is presented, the mnemonic characters
being reproduced on <a href = "#plateXVIc">Pl. <span class =

When the ordinary course of treatment fails to relieve the patient the
fact is made known to the Midē´ priests and he is consequently taken to
the Midē´wigân and laid upon blankets so that part of his body may rest
against the sacred midē´ stone. Associate Midē´ then attend, in
consultation, with the Midē´-in-chief, the other members present
occupying seats around the walls of the structure.</p>

<p>The accompanying lecture is then addressed to the sick person,
viz:</p>

<blockquote>Mi-shosh´-yâ-gwa´ ga´-a-nin-nan´ gi´-de-wēn´-du-nŭn
ne´-tun-ga´-da-da-we´-in man´-i-dōmī´-gis. Kit´-ti-mâ´-gĭ-si

bi-mâ-di-si-wĭn´.</blockquote>

<p>The following is a free translation of the above:</p>

<blockquote>The time of which I spoke to you has now arrived, and you
may deem it necessary to first borrow the sacred mī´gis. Who are you
that comes here as a supplicant? Sit down opposite to me, where I can
see you and speak to you, and fix your attention upon me, while you
receive life you must not permit your thoughts to dwell upon your
present condition, but to support yourself against falling into
despondency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now we are ready to try him; now we are ready to initiate
him.</blockquote>

<p>The reference to borrowing a mī´gis signifies that the patient may
have this mysterious power “shot into his body” where he lies upon the
ground and before he has arrived at the place where candidates are
properly initiated; this, because of his inability to walk round the
inclosure.</p>

<p>If the patient becomes strong enough to walk round the inclosure he
is led to the western end and seated upon a blanket, where he is
initiated. If not, the mī´gis is “shot into his body” as he reclines
against the sacred stone, after which a substitute is selected from
among the Midē´ present, who takes his place and goes through the
remainder of the initiation for him. Before proceeding upon either
course, however, the chief attendant Midē´ announces his readiness in
the following manner: Mi´-o-shi´-gwa, wi-kwod´-gi-o-wŏg´
ga-mâ´-dzhi-a-ka´-dŭng bi-mâ-di-si-wĭn´&mdash;“Now we are ready to

<p>Before concluding, it may be of interest to refer in some detail to
several subjects mentioned in the preceding pages. The mnemonic songs
are in nearly every instance incised upon birch bark by means of a
sharp-pointed piece of bone or a nail. The inner surface of the bark is
generally selected because it is softer than the reverse. Bark for such
purposes is peeled from the trunk during the spring months. On the right
hand upper corner of <a href = "#plateXIX">Pl. <span class =

of a mnemonic song showing characters as thus drawn. The specimen was
obtained at White Earth, and the entire song is presented on <a href =
"#plateXVIc">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XVI</span>,&nbsp;C</a>. A
piece of bark obtained at Red Lake, and known to have been incised more
than seventy years ago, is shown on the right lower corner of <a href =
"#plateXIX">Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">XIX</span></a>. The

Plate XIX. Sacred Birch Bark Records.</p>

<p>In a majority of songs the characters are drawn so as to be read from
left to right, in some from right to left, and occasionally one is found
to combine both styles, being truly boustrophic. Specimens have been
obtained upon which the characters were drawn around and near the margin
of an oblong piece of bark, thus appearing in the form of an irregular
circle.</p>

<p>The pictographic delineation of ideas is found to exist chiefly among
the shamans, hunters, and travelers of the Ojibwa, and there does not
appear to be a recognized system by which the work of any one person is
fully intelligible to another. A record may be recognized as pertaining
to the Midē´ ceremonies, as a song used when hunting plants, etc.; but
it would be impossible for one totally unfamiliar with the record to
state positively whether the initial character was at the left or the
right hand. The figures are more than simply mnemonic; they are
ideographic, and frequently possess additional interest from the fact
that several ideas are expressed in combination. Col. Garrick Mallery,
U.S. Army, in a paper entitled “Recently Discovered Algonkian
Pictographs,” read before the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, at Cleveland, 1888, expressed this fact in the following
words:</p>

<blockquote>It is desirable to explain the mode of using the Midē´ and
other bark records of the Ojibwa and also those of other Algonkian
tribes to be mentioned in this paper. The comparison made by Dr.
E.&nbsp;B. Tylor of the pictorial alphabet to teach children “A was an
archer,” etc., is not strictly appropriate in this case. The devices are
not only mnemonic, but are also ideographic and descriptive. They are
not merely invented to express or memorize the subject, but are evolved
therefrom. To persons acquainted with secret societies a good comparison
for the charts or rolls would be what is called the tressel board of the
Masonic order, which is printed and published and publicly exposed
without exhibiting any of the secrets of the order, yet is not only
significant, but useful to the esoteric in assistance to their memory as
to degrees and details of ceremony.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A more general mode of explaining the so-called symbolism is
by a suggestion that the charts of the order or the song of a myth
should be likened to the popular illustrated poems and songs lately
published in Harper’s Magazine for instance, “Sally in our Alley,” where
every stanza has an appropriate illustration. Now, suppose that the text
was obliterated forever, indeed the art of reading lost, the
illustrations remaining, as also the memory to many persons of the
ballad. The illustrations kept in order would supply always the order of
the stanzas and also the general subject-matter of each particular
stanza and the latter would be a reminder of the words. This is what the
rolls of birch bark do to the initiated Ojibwa, and what Schoolcraft
pretended in some cases to show, but what for actual
<span class = "pagenum">288</span>
<a name = "page288" id = "page288"> </a>
<!--png 370-->
understanding requires that all the vocables of the actual songs and
charges of the initiation should be recorded and translated. This
involves not only profound linguistic study, but the revelation of all
the mysteries. In other instances the literation in the aboriginal
language of the nonesoteric songs and stories and their translation is
necessary to comprehend the devices by which they are memorized rather
than symbolized. Nevertheless, long usage has induced some degree of
ideography and symbolism.</blockquote>

Plate XX. Sacred Bark Scroll And Contents.</p>

<p>On <a href = "#plateXX">Pl.&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">XX</span></a> are presented illustrations of several
articles found in a Midē´ sack which had been delivered to the Catholic
priest at Red Lake over seventy years ago, when the owner professed
Christianity and forever renounced (at least verbally) his pagan
profession. The information given below was obtained from Midē´ priests
at the above locality. They are possessed of like articles, being
members of the same society to which the late owners of the relics
belonged. The first is a birch-bark roll, the ends of which were slit
into short strips, so as to curl in toward the middle to prevent the
escaping of the contents. The upper figure is that of the Thunder god,
with waving lines extending forward from the eyes, denoting the power of
peering into futurity. This character has suggested to several Midē´
priests that the owner might have been a Midē´-Jĕs´sakkīd´. This belief
is supported by the actual practice pursued by this class of priests
when marking their personal effects. The lower figure is that of a
buffalo, as is apparent from the presence of the hump. Curiously enough
both eyes are drawn upon one side of the head, a practice not often
followed by Indian artists.</p>

<p>The upper of the four small figures is a small package, folded,
consisting of the inner sheet of birch-bark and resembling paper both in
consistence and color. Upon the upper fold is the outline of the Thunder
bird. The next two objects represent small boxes made of pine wood,
painted or stained red and black. They were empty when received, but
were no doubt used to hold sacred objects. The lowest figure of the four
consists of a bundle of three small bags of cotton wrapped with a strip
of blue cloth. The bags contain, respectively, love powder, hunter’s
medicine&mdash;in this instance red ocher and powdered arbor vitæ
leaves&mdash;and another powder of a brownish color, with which is mixed
a small quantity of ground medicinal plants.</p>

<p>The roll of birch-bark containing these relics inclosed also the skin
of a small rodent (Spermophilus sp.?) but in a torn and moth-eaten
condition. This was used by the owner for purposes unknown to those who
were consulted upon the subject. It is frequently, if not generally,
impossible to ascertain the use of most of the fetiches and other sacred
objects contained in Midē´ sacks of unknown ownership, as each priest
adopts his own line of practice, based upon a variety of reasons,
chiefly the nature of his fasting dreams.</p>

something of European origin, as exemplified in the specimen illustrated
on. <a href = "#plateXXI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXI</span></a>,
Nos. 1 and 2, showing both the obverse and reverse. The specimen is made
of ash wood and measures about ten inches in length. On the obverse
side, besides the figures of man´-idōs, such as the Thunder bird, the
serpent, and the tortoise, there is the outline of the sun, spots copied
from playing cards, etc.; upon the reverse appear two spread hands, a
bird, and a building, from the top of which floats the American flag.
This specimen was found among the effects of a Midē´ who died at Leech
Lake, Minnesota, a few years ago, together with effigies and other
relics already mentioned in another part of this paper.</p>

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "music" id = "music">
MUSIC.</a></h5>

<p>In addition to the examples of Indian music that have been given,
especially the songs of shamans, it may be of interest to add a few
remarks concerning the several varieties of songs or chants. Songs
employed as an accompaniment to dances are known to almost all the
members of the tribe, so that their rendition is nearly always the same.
Such songs are not used in connection with mnemonic characters, as there
are, in most instances, no words or phrases recited, but simply a
continued repetition of meaningless words or syllables. The notes are
thus rhythmically accentuated, often accompanied by beats upon the drum
and the steps of the dancers.</p>

<p>An example of another variety of songs, or rather chants, is
presented in connection with the reception of the candidate by the Midē´
priest upon his entrance into the Midē´wigân of the first degree. In
this instance words are chanted, but the musical rendition differs with
the individual, each Midē´ chanting notes of his own, according to his
choice or musical ability. There is no set formula, and such songs, even
if taught to others, are soon distorted by being sung according to the
taste or ability of the singer. The musical rendering of the words and
phrases relating to the signification of mnemonic characters depends
upon the ability and inspired condition of the singer; and as each Midē´
priest usually invents and prepares his own songs, whether for
ceremonial purposes, medicine hunting, exorcism, or any other use, he
may frequently be unable to sing them twice in exactly the same manner.
Love songs and war songs, being of general use, are always sung in the
same style of notation.</p>

<p>The emotions are fully expressed in the musical rendering of the
several classes of songs, which are, with few exceptions, in a minor
key. Dancing and war songs are always in quick time, the latter
frequently becoming extraordinarily animated and boisterous as the
participants become more and more excited.</p>

<p>Midē´ and other like songs are always more or less monotonous, though
they are sometimes rather impressive, especially if delivered
<span class = "pagenum">290</span>
<a name = "page290" id = "page290"> </a>
<!--png 374-->
by one sufficiently emotional and possessed of a good voice. Some of the
Midē´ priests employ few notes, not exceeding a range of five, for all
songs, while others frequently cover the octave, terminating with a
final note lower still.</p>

<p>The statement has been made that one Midē´ is unable either to recite
or sing the proper phrase pertaining to the mnemonic characters of a
song belonging to another Midē´ unless specially instructed. The
representation of an object may refer to a variety of ideas of a
similar, though not identical, character. The picture of a bear may
signify the Bear man´idō as one of the guardians of the society; it may
pertain to the fact that the singer impersonates that man´idō; exorcism
of the malevolent bear spirit may be thus claimed; or it may relate to
the desired capture of the animal, as when drawn to insure success for
the hunter. An Indian is slow to acquire the exact phraseology, which is
always sung or chanted, of mnemonic songs recited to him by a Midē´
preceptor.</p>

<p>An exact reproduction is implicitly believed to be necessary, as
otherwise the value of the formula would be impaired, or perhaps even
totally destroyed. It frequently happens, therefore, that although an
Indian candidate for admission into the Mīdē´wiwin may already have
prepared songs in imitation of those from which he was instructed, he
may either as yet be unable to sing perfectly the phrases relating
thereto, or decline to do so because of a want of confidence. Under such
circumstances the interpretation of a record is far from satisfactory,
each character being explained simply objectively, the true import being
intentionally or unavoidably omitted. An Ojibwa named “Little
Frenchman,” living at Red Lake, had received almost continuous
instruction for three or four years, and although he was a willing and
valuable assistant in other matters pertaining to the subject under
consideration, he was not sufficiently familiar with some of his
preceptor’s songs to fully explain them. A few examples of such mnemonic
songs are presented in illustration, and for comparison with such as
have already been recorded. In each instance the Indian’s interpretation
of the character is given first, the notes in brackets being supplied in
further explanation. <a href = "#plateXXIIa">Pl. <span class =

birch-bark songs found among the effects of a deceased Midē´ priest, at

songs were exhibited to many Midē´ priests
from various portions of the Ojibwa country, in the hope of obtaining
some satisfactory explanation regarding the import of the several
characters; but, although they were pronounced to be “Grand Medicine,”
no suggestions were offered beyond the merest repetition of the name of
the object or what it probably was meant to represent. The direction of
their order was mentioned, because in most instances the initial
character furnishes the guide. Apart from this, the illustrations are of
interest as exhibiting the superior character and cleverness of their
execution.</p>

DRESS AND ORNAMENTS.</a></h5>

<p>While it is customary among many tribes of Indians to use as little
clothing as possible when engaged in dancing, either of a social or
ceremonial nature, the Ojibwa, on the contrary, vie with one another in
the attempt to appear in the most costly and gaudy dress attainable. The
Ojibwa Midē´ priests, take particular pride in their appearance when
attending ceremonies of the Midē´ Society, and seldom fail to impress
this fact upon visitors, as some of the Dakotan tribes, who have adopted
similar medicine ceremonies after the custom of their Algonkian
neighbors, are frequently without any clothing other than the
breechcloth and moccasins, and the armlets and other attractive
ornaments. This disregard of dress appears, to the Ojibwa, as a
sacrilegious digression from the ancient usages, and it frequently
excites severe comment.</p>

<p>Apart from facial ornamentation, of such design as may take the
actor’s fancy, or in accordance with the degree of which the subject may
be a member, the Midē´ priests wear shirts, trousers, and moccasins, the
first two of which may consist of flannel or cloth and be either plain
or ornamented with beads, while the latter are always of buckskin, or,
what is more highly prized, moose skin, beaded or worked with colored
porcupine quills.</p>

<p>Immediately below each knee is tied a necessary item of an Ojibwa’s
dress, a garter, which consists of a band of beads varying in different
specimens from 2 to 4 inches in width, and from 18 to 20 inches in
length, to each end of which strands of colored wool yarn, 2 feet long,
are attached so as to admit of being passed around the leg and tied in a
bow-knot in front. These garters are made by the women in such patterns
as they may be able to design or elaborate. On <a href =
"#plateXXIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXIII</span></a> are
reproductions of parts of two patterns which are of more than ordinary
interest, because of the symbolic signification of the colors and the
primitive art design in one, and the substitution of colors and the
introduction of modern designs in the other. The upper one consists of
green, red, and white beads, the first two colors being in accord with
those of one of the degree posts, while the white is symbolical of the
mī´gis shell. In the lower illustration is found a substitution of color
for the preceding, accounted for by the Midē´ informants, who explained
that neither of the varieties of beads of the particular color desired
could be obtained when wanted. The yellow beads are substituted for
white, the blue for green, and the orange and pink for red. The design
retains the lozenge form, though in a different arrangement, and the
introduction of the blue border is adapted after patterns observed among
their white neighbors. In the former is presented also what the Ojibwa
term the groundwork or type of their original style of ornamentation,
i.e., wavy or gently zigzag lines. Later art work consists
<span class = "pagenum">299</span>
<a name = "page299" id = "page299"> </a>
<!--png 389-->
chiefly of curved lines, and this has gradually become modified through
instruction from the Catholic sisters at various early mission
establishments until now, when there has been brought about a common
system of working upon cloth or velvet, in patterns, consisting of
vines, leaves, and flowers, often exceedingly attractive though not
aboriginal in the true sense of the word.</p>

<p>Bands of flannel or buckskin, handsomely beaded, are sometimes
attached to the sides of the pantaloons, in imitation of an officer’s
stripes, and around the bottom. Collars are also used, in addition to
necklaces of claws, shells, or other objects.</p>

<p>Armlets and bracelets are sometimes made of bands of beadwork, though
brass wire or pieces of metal are preferred.</p>

<p>Bags made of cloth, beautifully ornamented or entirely covered with
beads, are worn, supported at the side by means of a broad band or
baldric passing over the opposite shoulder. The head is decorated with
disks of metal and tufts of colored horse hair or moose hair and with
eagle feathers to designate the particular exploits performed by the
wearer.</p>

<p>Few emblems of personal valor or exploits are now worn, as many of
the representatives of the present generation have never been actively
engaged in war, so that there is generally found only among the older
members the practice of wearing upon the head eagle feathers bearing
indications of significant markings or cuttings. A feather which has
been split from the tip toward the middle denotes that the wearer was
wounded by an arrow. A red spot as large as a silver dime painted upon a
feather shows the wearer to have been wounded by a bullet. The privilege
of wearing a feather tipped with red flannel or horse hair dyed red is
recognized only when the wearer has killed an enemy, and when a great
number have been killed in war the so-called war bonnet is worn, and may
consist of a number of feathers exceeding the number of persons killed,
the idea to be expressed being “a great number,” rather than a specific
enumeration.</p>

<p>Although the Ojibwa admit that in former times they had many other
specific ways of indicating various kinds of personal exploits, they now
have little opportunity of gaining such distinction, and consequently
the practice has fallen into desuetude.</p>

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "future" id = "future">
FUTURE OF THE SOCIETY.</a></h5>

<p>According to a treaty now being made between the United States
Government and the Ojibwa Indians, the latter are to relinquish the
several areas of land at present occupied by them and to remove to
portions of the Red Lake and White Earth Reservations and take lands in
severalty. By this treaty about 4,000,000 acres of land will be ceded to
the Government, and the members of the various bands will become
citizens of the United States, and thus their tribal ties
<span class = "pagenum">300</span>
<a name = "page300" id = "page300"> </a>
<!--png 390-->
will be broken and their primitive customs and rites be abandoned.</p>

<p>The chief Midē´ priests, being aware of the momentous consequences of
such a change in their habits, and foreseeing the impracticability of
much longer continuing the ceremonies of so-called “pagan rites,” became
willing to impart them to me, in order that a complete description might
be made and preserved for the future information of their
descendants.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any doubt that these ceremonies will still be
secretly held at irregular intervals; but under the watchful care of the
national authorities it is doubtful whether they will be performed with
any degree of completeness, and it will be but a comparatively short
time before the Midē´wiwin will be only a tradition.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
